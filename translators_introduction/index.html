<p>Almost universally, religious traditions have stressed the importance
of the condition of the heart. In the Muslim scripture, the Day of
Judgment is described as, "<em>a day in which neither wealth nor children
shall be of any benefit [to anyone], except one who comes to God with
a sound heart</em> (QUR'AN, 26:88–89)." The sound heart is understood to
be free of character defects and spiritual blemishes. This "heart" is
actually the spiritual heart and not the physical organ per
se, although in Islamic tradition the spiritual heart is centered in
the physical. […]</p>

<hr />

<p>The Prophet of Islam ﷺ spoke of the heart as a repository of
knowledge and a vessel sensitive to the deeds of the body. He said,
for example, that wrongdoing irritates the heart. So the heart
actually perceives wrong action. In fact, when people do terrible
things, the core of their humanity is injured. Fyodor Dostoyevsky
expresses brilliantly in <em>Crime and Punishment</em> that the crime itself
is the punishment because human beings ultimately have to live with
the painful consequences of their deeds. When someone commits a crime,
he does so first against his own heart, which then affects the whole
human being. The person enters a state of spiritual agitation and
often tries to suppress it. The root meaning of the work <em>kufr</em>
(disbelief) is <em>to cover</em> something up. As it relates to this
discussion, the problems we see in our society come down to covering
up or suppressing the symptoms of its troubles. The agents used to do
this include alcohol, drugs, sexual experimentation and deviance,
power grabs, wealth, arrogance, pursuit of fame, and the like. These
enable people to submerge themselves into a state of heedlessness
concerning their essential nature. People work very hard to cut
themselves off from their hearts and the natural feelings found
there. The pressures to do this are very strong in our modern culture.</p>

<p>One of the major drawbacks of being severed from the heart is that the
more one is severed, the sicker the heart becomes, for the heart needs
nourishment. Heedlessness starves the heart, robs it of its spiritual
manna. One enters into a state of unawareness—a debilitating lack of
awareness of God and an acute neglect of humanity's ultimate
destination: the infinite world of the Hereafter. When one peers into
the limitless world through remembrance of God and increases in
beneficial knowledge, one's concerns become more focused on the
infinite world, not the finite one that is disappearing and
ephemeral. When people are completely immersed in the material world,
believing that this world is all that matters and all that exists and
that they are not accountable for their actions, they affect a
spiritual death of their hearts. Before the heart dies, however, it
shows symptoms of affliction. These afflictions are spiritual diseases
of the heart (the center of our being)—the topic of this book.</p>

<p>In Islamic tradition, these diseases fall under two categories. The
first is known as <em>shubuhat</em> or <em>obfuscations</em>. These are diseases
that relate to impaired or inappropriate understanding. For instance,
if somebody is fearful that God will not provide for him or her, this
is considered a disease of the heart because a sound heart has
knowledge and trust, not doubt and anxiety […]</p>

<p>The second category of disease concerns the base desires of the self
and is called <em>shahawat</em>. This relates to our desires exceeding their
natural state, as when people live merely to satisfy these urges and
are led by them. Islam provides the method by which our hearts can
become sound and safe again. This method has been the subject of
brilliant and insightful scholarship for centuries in the Islamic
tradition. One can say that Islam in essence is a program to restore
purity and calm to the heart through the remembrance of God.</p>

<hr />

<p>This present text is based on the poem known as <em>Matharat al-Qulub</em>
(literally, <em>Purification of the Hearts</em>), which offers the means by
which purification can be achieved. It is a treatise on the "alchemy
of the hearts," namely, a manual on how to transform the heart. It was
written by a great scholar and saint, Shaykh Muhammad Mawlud
al-Ya'qubi al-Musawi Al-Muratani. As his name indicates, he was from
Mauritania in West Africa. He was a master of all the Islamic
sciences, including the inward sciences of the heart. He stated that
he wrote this poem because he observed the prevalence of diseased
hearts. He saw students of religion spending their time learning
abstract sciences that people were not really in need of, to the
neglect of those sciences that pertain to what people are accountable
for in the next life, namely, the spiritual condition of the heart. In
one of his most cited statements, the Prophet ﷺ said, "Actions
are based upon intentions." All deeds are thus valued according to the
intentions behind them, and intentions emanate from the heart. So
every action a person intends or performs is rooted in the heart.</p>

<hr />

<p>If we examine the trials and tribulations, wars and other conflicts,
every act of injustice all over earth, we'll find they all rooted in
human hearts. Covetousness, the desire to aggress and exploit, the
longing to pilfer natural resources, the inordinate love of wealth and
position, and other maladies are manifestations of diseases found
nowhere but in the heart. Every criminal, miser, abuser, scoffer,
embezzler, and hateful person does what he or she does because of a
diseased heart. If hearts were sound, these actions would no longer be
a reality. So if we want to change our world, we do not begin by
rectifying the outward. Instead, we must change the condition of our
inward. Everything we see happening outside of us is in reality coming
from the unseen world within. It <em>is</em> from the unseen world that the
phenomenal world emerges, and it is from the unseen realm of our
hearts that all actions spring.</p>

<p>The well-known civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. said that
in order for people to condemn injustice, they must go through four
stages. The first stage is that people must ascertain that indeed
injustices are being perpetrated. In this case, it was injustices
against African Americans in the United States. The second stage is to
negotiate, that is, approach the oppressor and demand justice. If the
oppressor refuses, King said that the third stage is
self-purification, which starts with the question: "Are we ourselves
wrongdoers?" Are we ourselves oppressors?" The fourth stage, then, is
to take action after true self-examination, after removing one's own
wrongs before demanding justice from others […]</p>

<hr />

<p>[…] Impure people oppress, and the pure-hearted not only forgive
their oppressors, but elevate them in status and character. In order
to purify ourselves, we must begin to recognize this truth. This is
what this book is all about—a book of self-purification and a manual
of liberation. If we work on our hearts, if we actually implement what
is suggested here, we'll begin to see changes in our lives, our
condition, our society, and even within our own family dynamics. It is
a blessing that we have this science of purification, a blessing that
this teaching exists in the world today. What remains is for us to
take these teachings seriously.</p>

<p>[…] But just like medicinal prescriptions, the physician cannot
force you to take it. The knowledgeable scholars of spiritual
purification have given us the treatment, as they have gleaned it from
the teachings of the Qur'an and the exemplary model of the Prophet
ﷺ. The teachings are available. They are clear, and they
work. It is then up to us to learn and apply them to ourselves and
share them with others.</p>
