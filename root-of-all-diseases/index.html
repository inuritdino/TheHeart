<h3 id="poem-verses-189ndash196">Poem verses 189–196</h3>
<div class="poem">

  <p>The root cause of all of these diseases is love of the temporal
    world. This is the opinion of both al-Hila&#773;l&#305;&#773; and
    Ibn 'A&#773;shir.</p>

  <p>Ibn 'At&#803;a&#773;'alla&#773;h, on the other hand, considered
    the root cause of every disease to be man's self-satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the root cause of all good qualities is the lack of
    self-satisfaction. And this conclusion is obvious</p>

  <p>Because being [dissatisfied with oneself] prompts you to seek
    virtuous character and to vigilantly avoid what is
    inappropriate.</p>

  <p>The origin of either of these states relates to the company one
    keeps [from either camp], for a man's character is that of the
    company he keeps.</p>

  <p>Thus, if a man achieves any state, inevitably his companions will
    be affected by it.</p>

  <p>For this reason, Luqma&#773;n, the full moon of wisdom, advised
    his son to keep close company with the people of knowledge.</p>

  <p>He compared the effect of the reviving light of wisdom upon the
    heart to that of a lush downpour upon the barren earth.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>

<p>The comprehensive root of the heart's diseases, according to Imam
Mawlu̅d, is love of the temporal world, which he cites as the
opinion of Imam al-Hila̅lı̅ and Imam Ibn
'A̅shir. Ibn 'Abba̅s said that it was covetousness
(<i>ṭama'</i>). There are differences of opinion regarding the
mother cause of diseases of the heart, but their differences are
shades of understanding rather than alternate paradigms. When Imam Ibn
'A̅shir says that it is the love of power and authority, it comes
down to love of the world. What is power and authority other than
branches of the world?</p>

<p>Imam Ibn 'Aṭa̅'alla̅h, who is often quoted in this
book and mentioned by name in this passage of Imam Mawlu̅d's
poem, was a master of the science of the heart. His book of aphorisms
is one of the most highly regarded masterpieces in Islamic spiritual
tradition. His 35th aphorism in that collection reads,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The source of every disobedience, indifference, and passion is
self-satisfaction. The source of every obedience, vigilance, and
virtue is dissatisfaction with one's self. It is better for you to
keep company with an ignorant man dissatisfied with himself than to
keep company with a learned man satisfied with himself. For what
knowledge is there in a self-satisfied scholar? And what ignorance is
there in an unlearned man dissatisfied with himself?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowadays, there is an urgency to root out the feeling of
shame. However, dissatisfaction with oneself is the very thing that
causes people to reflect and reevaluate, which is requisite for
spiritual success. Shame and dissatisfaction can be moral
lifesavers. (Shame is different from low self-esteem, in which one
feels contempt for himself.)</p>

<p>Three signs of being overly content with the soul (according to
Sı̅dı̅ Aḥmad Zarru̅q):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Being sensitive to one's own rights and indifferent to the rights
of others. In Islam, one's responsibilities preponderate over one's
rights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ignoring one's own faults, as if one has none, while being
preoccupied with the faults of others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giving oneself too much leniency.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Three signs that someone is not content with himself (according to
Sı̅dı̅ Aḥmad Zarru̅q):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When a person checks himself, is self-accusing, and wary of his
intentions. Joseph (peace be upon him), who was known for his
exceptional purity, said, "<i>I do not declare myself innocent, but
the soul often commands evil, except upon one whom my Lord has
mercy</i>" (QUR'AN, 12:53). One should ask oneself, "Am I doing this
for show or for the sake of God?"</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Being careful of the blemishes of the soul. The Prophet ﷺ
supplicated, "O God, do not leave me to the soul even for a blink of
an eye."</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Forcing the self to do difficult things, such as eating less and
spending money in charity.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Being vigilant about one's own faults does not amount to self-loathing
or depletion of confidence. In fact, confidence gives one the courage
to find fault in oneself.</p>

<p>A master of any craft is not one who achieves a certain level of
proficiency and stops, but one who is committed to constant
improvement.</p>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d says that dissatisfaction is a motivator to seek out
better character. A human being is spiritually stalled as long as he
is content and smug with his sate. The basis of achieving good is
knowing oneself. When this happens, a person becomes aware of his
imperfections, minor and major, and is ashamed of them to the point he
strives to replace them with generosity, agreeableness, honesty,
reliability, dignity, and other noble traits.</p>

<p>When the mind is given the responsibility to decide upon right and
wrong, it usually bases its judgment subjectively: what advances or
thwarts one's whims? Our understanding of right and wrong, licit and
illicit, needs a judge higher than ourselves and our whims. We are
beings who have been created and, therefore, have a Creator who
brought us into existence for a reason. It is His purpose and guidance
that informs our sensitivity and response to right and wrong.</p>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d states that diseases and blessings are related to
the company one keeps. As it is said, "If you sit at the door of a
tavern, you will either walk in and partake or merely smell the stench
of alcohol and drunkards. But if you sit at the door of a perfumer, you
will either walk in and wear the scent or at least enjoy the
fragrance."</p>

<p>The learned are like rain that quickens a lifeless land. Sitting with
esteemed company enlivens the heart and makes it more fertile for the
growth of faith (<i>ima̅n</i>). It will take one from six
detrimental things to six beneficial things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>doubt to certainty;</li>
  <li>ostentation in acts to sincerity;</li>
  <li>heedlessness to remembrance;</li>
  <li>desire for this world to desire for the Hereafter;</li>
  <li>arrogance to humbleness;</li>
  <li>and a bad internal nature to an excellent one.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="poem-verses-197ndash204">Poem verses 197–204</h3>
<div class="poem">

  <p>Remember God much, and know that the Qur'an is the best of
    it. This rule excludes those times when other types [of remembrance]
    have been prescribed.</p>

  <p>Begin by asking for forgiveness and benedictions upon [Prophet
    Muhammad &#65018;], our guide to all good things.</p>

  <p>Have the same reverence [during remembrance] as you would during
    prayer and guard yourself from any mispronunciations, for that is
    among the prohibitions.</p>

  <p>Whoever adds a long vowel, for instance, after the ha' in
    ila&#773;ha when he is saying la&#773; ila&#773;ha
    illa&#773; l-la&#773;h, or adds a vowel to the hamzah at the onset
    of the word</p>

  <p>Has committed a wrong deed, according to the consensus of the
    righteous people. Furthermore, he has worshipped God but did so
    disobediently [by his neglect of tajw&#305;&#773;d].</p>

  <p>This is what has been clearly stated in [the book]
    al-Khaz&#305;&#773;nah by one whose speech has been illuminated by
    serenity.</p>

  <p>It is necessary when engaged in remembrance that every letter be
    pronounced with precision in terms of its origin and linguistic
    attributes.</p>

  <p>The most virtuous form of devotion is contemplative reflection
    and the best of that is annihilation of the self, which is the
    supreme station.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="discussion-1">Discussion</h3>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d speaks next of the importance of <i>dhikr</i>, the
remembrance of God, which is vital to the cure of each disease of the
heart (and society). He mentions the exceptional excellence of reciting
the Qur'an. When one recites while reflecting deeply on the meaning of
the words, doors of insight open and one's faith (<i>ima̅n</i>)
grows stronger.</p>

<p>It is better to recite from the copy of the Qur'an itself than from
memorization, since it involves the eyes, hands, and ears. Not
understanding the language of the Qur'an should not bar one from
receiving the blessings in this exalted practice. The only time when
the Qur'an is not the preferred <i>dhikr</i> is when other obligations
are immediately pressing.</p>

<p>The remembrance of God exceeds in merit even jihad, since <i>dhikr</i>
is an end, while jihad is a means to removing aggression. It is
generally known that the ends are higher than the means, for we were
created to remember God, and all else that we do is in order to
establish the conditions that permit this remembrance.</p>

<p>One of the great things about <i>dhikr</i> is that it is different
from other acts of worship, like Pilgrimage and prayer. Remembrance is
not time restricted; it is associated with all aspects of life, such
as meals, getting dressed, traveling, retiring for sleep, even sexual
intimacy (for which there is a known supplication), and the like. It
is said that when one is in the state of remembrance, any affliction
that comes to him or her raises that person's rank, and if one dies in
the state of remembrance, he or she dies as a martyr. Also, if one's
last words are, "There is no deity but God," he or she enters Heaven.</p>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d says that in making remembrance, one should start
with seeking God's forgiveness (<i>istighfa̅r</i>) for his or her
neglect and misdeeds, past or immediate. <i>Istighfa̅r</i> is the
process of asking God to remit our sins and cleanse us of their ill
effects. One should say, for example, at least 100 times in a day
"<i>astaghfiru l-la̅h</i>," which means, "I seek forgiveness from
God." One should also begin with benedictions on the Prophet ﷺ,
that is, asking God to bless him and grant him peace. Many scholars
have specified benediction of the Prophet ﷺ as particularly
effective because it is a prayer that is guaranteed to be answered by
God.</p>

<p>Whoever prays for the Prophet ﷺ one time, God prays on that
person ten times. The Prophet ﷺ was aware of his station as the
Seal of the Prophets, and he believed in what God has revealed to him,
as the Qur'an states (QUR'AN, 2:285). He was unabashed in relating to
his Companions (and all the generations after them) what will be of
benefit to them in this life and the next, including invoking prayers
of blessing upon him. Such prayers, as he has said, shall be a light
when we need light the most, in the dark grave and on the Traverse,
the bridge that crosses over Hellfire, over which everyone must
cross. It is also light in the heart.</p>

<p>When praying on the Prophet ﷺ, one should have the same
reverence and comportment that one has when performing
other <i>dhikr</i>, like having ablution (<i>wudu̅'</i>) and
facing toward the direction of Mecca (the qiblah) when possible. What
is recommended for prayer (<i>ṣala̅h</i>) is recommended
for <i>dhikr</i>: cleanliness, perfume, and cleaning the teeth with a
tooth-stick (<i>siwa̅k</i>). When one says "<i>la̅
ila̅ha illa̅ l-la̅h</i>" (there is no deity but God),
he negates polytheism and idolatry. If one says "<i>al-ḥamdu li
l-la̅h</i>" (all praise is for God), he is reminded of the
constant blessings that God has bestowed. When one says "<i>la̅
ḥawla wa la̅ qu̅wata illa̅ billa̅h</i>"
(there is no might or power except with God), he disengages himself of
any illusion of having power, for all of it is with God. When one
prays on the Prophet ﷺ, it is appropriate to imagine the
Prophet ﷺ teaching us guidance and the proper way to
worship—essential teachings that we never would have learned had
he not taught us. We must also remember God's love for him.</p>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d states that when engaged in remembrance it is
important to pronounce the words well and to avoid incorrect
pronunciation to the best of one's ability. Mispronunciation of some
words can change their meaning. When one engages in remembrance he
should do so with every letter (the book <i>Khazı̅nah
al-Asra̅r</i> by Sı̅dı̅ 'Abd Alla̅h Ould
Ḥajj Ibra̅hı̅m). One should not drag his tongue
lazily, especially in reciting the Qur'an. Proper pronunciation lends
itself to deeper comprehension of what one is saying. For those who
have difficulty in pronouncing some of the letter, they, of course,
can still engage in remembrance, doing their best with matters of
pronunciation.</p>

<p>To reflect on God's creation is known as a great act of worship, a
practice that helps a person see the signs—those glimpses of the
unseen purposely placed in the physical world so that we may be
increased in faith and certitude. This meditative contemplation, as
Imam Mawlu̅d states, is the most virtuous of devotions. Those
inclined to reflection are known as people of understanding and are
described as those who remember God
while <i>standing</i>, <i>sitting</i>, or <i>lying on their
sides</i>. As they reflect on the creation of the heavens and the
earth, they say, "<i>Our Lord, You have not created this in vain. Glory
be to You!</i> (QUR'AN, 3:191). This combines remembrance of God with
a presence of heart and mind that augments the power of remembrance.</p>

<p>The objects of reflection (<i>tafakkur</i>) are many. One may reflect
on the verses of the Qur'an. Another may reflect on the signs of God
in creation or reflect on the promise of God, the reward that He
guarantees believers who are patient and obedient. Such reflection
creates ardent desire and hope for Paradise with its unfathomable
bliss, peace, provision, landscapes, and excellent company. Likewise,
one reflects on the punishment God has promised those who choose
wickedness over purity, misguidance over guidance, and corruption over
wholesomeness. Reflecting on the terrors of the grave and the horrors
of Hell instills the kind of dread that strengthens a person's resolve
to never stray from the path of God. When we reflect on all that God
has given us that infinitely exceeds the measure of what we deserve,
and then reflect on what little is required from us, this extinguishes
self-righteousness and arrogance and increases gratitude.</p>

<p>People ask about those who engage in a great deal of remembrance yet
neglect or ignore the obligatory rites of worship as if they have
transcended the need for these rites. This is unmitigated
ignorance. The first and foremost obligation on every human being is
to gain knowledge. When God created us, He gave us accountability and
the means and ability to carry out our responsibilities. Anyone who
does not care to learn the first order of knowledge is living the life
of a farm animal, a creature that does nothing but graze in this life,
which is entirely insufficient in God's sight.</p>

<p>The scholars say that before <i>taṣawwuf</i> (inner sciences,
Sufism), there must be sacred law. <i>Taṣawwuf</i> without law
will lead one astray.</p>

<p>There is a confused sense of spirituality in which one feels he or she
can attain to level of perceiving reality fully without tending to the
responsibilities and obligations of the shariah. This is a misleading
phenomenon that spreads because of its appeal: spiritual sensation
without any moral obligation.</p>

<p>A Muslim tradition reports that Prophet David (peace be upon him) saw
a group of men remembering God and was impressed with them, but it was
revealed to him that these men were of no worth in the sight of God
because if a woman had come along and offered herself to any of them,
they would have accepted her offer.</p>

<p>We must remember that if a person has done wrong, the spiritual path
is not severed. There is the recourse of seeking repentance from
God. One should not confess or broadcast what he or she has done. If
God has veiled one's wrongdoing, do not tear the veil down.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is no better treatment for the diseases of the heart
than remembrance. Most of the other recommended cures either touch
upon or include the remembrance of God as essential.</p>

<p>The best of worship occurs with the combination of speech and
reflection. When practiced for a long time regularly, one achieves
what is called <i>fana̅'</i> in Sufi terminology. When one
reflects deeply, he separates himself from others and even from his own
limitations.</p>

<p>Imam al-Junayd says that in deep spiritual practice there can be
profound experiences. An example of one is a <i>ḥa̅l</i>,
which is an overwhelming spiritual state that is uncontrollable. The
scholars of this science differentiate between <i>ḥa̅l</i>
and <i>maqa̅m</i>. <i>Maqa̅m</i> is more or less a fixed
condition or station, whereas a <i>ḥa̅l</i> is a temporary
state, a momentary burst of spiritual epiphany. For example, the
station of repentance (<i>maqa̅m al-tawbah</i>) is one in which
one cannot willingly be disobedient to God. But
the <i>ḥa̅l</i> of repentance is when someone becomes so
overwhelmed with remorse over what he had done wrong in the past, he
rushes to God, the Exalted, and profoundly seeks His forgiveness with
a powerful sense of God's presence. It is an inrush that comes into
the heart, filling it with light and spiritual expansion. It is
highest when one is not aware of himself, only of God and His
attributes. This kind of extinction of the soul is caused by one's
focus and heightened spiritual experience.</p>

<p>Our objective is not merely to go through these spiritual experiences,
but to be firmly grounded in a path that takes us to the pleasure of
God and salvation in the Hereafter. If one performs remembrance
properly and often, things will happen to the inner
self. <i>Fana̅'</i> is founded on the sources of Islam and the
tutelage of learned people who have knowledge of both the shariah and
spiritual matters. The person who is doing <i>dhikr</i> with
reflection loses awareness of himself. There are authentic reports of
the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ and other righteous people of
later generations who, as they stood in prayer, were completely
unaware of their surroundings.</p>

<p>Muslims do believe that the human being can be in a profound state of
awareness of God's action in creation. The whole world is an act of
God and people can go into a state of absolute witnessing where they
see everything as being acts of God. They do not see otherness and
thus they recognize the Reality behind it. For this reason, the
believer sees good in all things, even in affliction and trial, in
which there is wisdom: an opportunity to grow, purify oneself, learn
patience, and draw near to God. Understanding this is the idea in
witnessing God's wisdom in events of the world.</p>

<p>Qadi Abu̅ Bakr Ibn al-'Arabı̅ said that Satan's
foremost objective with the believer is to separate him from the
remembrance of God, the Exalted. But if Satan finds believers doing
much remembrance, then he will try to turn them away from the
remembrance of God that is taken from the Qur'an and the supplications
and formulas stated by the Prophet ﷺ
himself. Sı̅dı̅ Aḥmad Zarru̅q said that
one should say the litanies that the Prophet ﷺ used to say,
especially those that he said often. After that, preference should be
given to the words of the Companions and the Successors
(<i>ta̅bi'u̅n</i>), and then to other people if they are
knowledgeable and known for their piety.</p>
