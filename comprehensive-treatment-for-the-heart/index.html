<h3 id="poem-verses-170ndash175">Poem verses 170–175</h3>
<div class="poem">

  <p>A comprehensive treatment plan for the heart's diseases is to
	deny the self of its desires,</p>
  
  <p>Enjoin hunger, keep worship vigilance in the night, be silent,
	and meditate in private;</p>

  <p>Also keep company with good people who possess sincerity, those
	who are emulated in their states and statements;</p>

  <p>And, finally, take refuge in the One unto whom all affairs
	return. That is the most beneficial treatment for all of the
	previous diseases.</p>

  <p>This must be to the point in which you are like a man drowning or
	someone lost in a barren desert and see no source of succor</p>

  <p>Except from the Guardian, possessor of the greatest power. He is
	the One who responds to the call of the distressed.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d completes his discussion on the various diseases and
turns his attention to a comprehensive treatment plan for the heart,
which focuses on curbing the soul from its own excessive desires. To
accomplish this, he states that one must engage in hunger, vigilance
during the nights, silence, and meditation in private.</p>

<h4 id="hunger">Hunger</h4>

<p>According to Christian tradition, the seven deadly sins comprise
arrogance, anger, envy, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust. The last two
relate to one's base desires, and they are the chief desires of the
soul. Gluttony and lust are founded upon natural inclinations of
hunger and sexual attraction. The pathology related to them, however,
pertains to excessiveness therein and satisfying one's urges in a
forbidden manner.</p>

<p>The stomach is the source of one's primary impulse. If one can learn
to control the desire for food, other issues of disciplines begin to
fall into place as well, for gluttony is the fuel for lust, and
fasting breaks gluttony.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that Imam Mawlu̅d mentions hunger first
among the comprehensive treatments for the heart. Eating is one of the
most abused behaviors. We are conditioned to think that hunger is
sated only when we feel full.</p>

<h4 id="night-prayer-vigil">Night prayer vigil</h4>

<p>If one wishes to enliven the heart, then one should give it time with
its Lord in the stillness of the dark, even if it is only
two <i>rak'ahs</i>. Imam Ma̅lik says to never leave the night
prayer vigil even for a little time. Being consistent with the night
prayer (and all other meritorious things) is important. It is better
to rise at night for just ten minutes on a regular basis than to stay
up for hours one night and then sleep the next night. The performance
of this prayer on a patchwork basis results in little
benefit. Sı̅dı̅ Aḥmad Zarru̅q said it
is like "drilling here and there, never finding water anywhere."</p>

<p>It is not our tradition for one to be excessive in spiritual
practices, such that one is deprived of sleep to the point of becoming
psychotic or deprived of food to the point that one's health is
damaged. On the contrary, one should learn to control the soul's
desires and not be controlled by them. The Prophet ﷺ said that
our bodies have rights over us: they are food, drink, and
companionship.</p>

<p>Not all of the Companions performed the night prayer, but many
did. For us, what is rational and reasonable is to have some steady
practice.</p>

<p>The night prayer vigil, like other acts of worship, is a gift that can
be taken away when, for example, the worshipper starts to backbite,
gossip, slander, consume unlawful food, earn illicit wealth, and so
on. One who has established an excellent regimen of worship may
suddenly find oneself unable to continue. It may be that the blessing
of being able to perform this righteous practice is removed because of
something bad one had done. When this occurs, one should repent and
strive to restore the practice. A scholar said, "I once said something
about someone I should not have said, and I was deprived of the night
prayer for forty days."</p>

<p>One should not push oneself to the point that supererogatory vigils
are a chore instead of a delight. Moderation ensures consistency and,
as a result, the reaching of one's destination.</p>

<h4 id="silence">Silence</h4>

<p>The tongue is a great temptation. It is easy to say something that
brings ruin upon its speaker. Learning how to control the tongue is an
enormous discipline. Imam al-Sha̅fi'ı̅ said that
whenever he was in a gathering and wanted to say something, he would
check his soul and be sure that his intentions were pure and were not
to prove himself or flaunt his knowledge. Imam
al-Sha̅fi'ı̅ was a man of great intelligence and
encyclopedic knowledge, yet he often enjoined silence upon himself. He
once said, "I never had a debate with anyone except that I prayed to
God that He make the truth appear on the tongue of my opponent so I
could submit to it."</p>

<p>When the Prophet ﷺ spoke, he always said the truth, even in
levity. He disliked verbosity and cautioned his Companions about the
tongue and what it earns. If it is words for the sake of words, it is
a waste of time and a sign of bad character.</p>

<h4 id="meditation-in-private">Meditation in private</h4>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d mentions spiritual isolation for the purpose of
reflection. Some remember death through visualization, using the
puissance of imagination for visualizing their bodies washed, wrapped,
and lowered in the grave. Others reflect on the attributes of God, the
Exalted, by methodically pondering the meanings of each of His divine
names that speak of God's awesome power, knowledge, clemency, mercy,
creative powers, and more.</p>

<h4 id="keeping-good-company">Keeping good company</h4>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d speaks of the importance of keeping the company of
good people, which is God's command: "<i>O you who believe, fear God
and be among the truthful ones</i>" (QUR'AN, 9:119). It is astonishing
how people can influence others simply by being in each other's
company. Imam al-Ḥadda̅d said, "The company one keeps has
major effects. It may lead to either benefit and improvement or harm
and corruption, depending on whether the company is that of pure and
eminent people or those who are immoral and evil. This effect does not
appear suddenly but is a gradual process that unfolds with time."</p>

<p>Sı̅dı̅ Aḥmad Zarru̅q said that one
should befriend people who elevate one's station. Good company
includes those who are in the state of gratitude; they are thankful
for what they have and do not waste time complaining. One take on their
excellent characteristics. Shaykh Ould al-Khadı̅m says that
when it comes to worldly possessions, it is good to associate with
people who have lesser means. The company of wealthy people opens a
person up to coveting what they have. When it comes to the Hereafter,
it is better to associate with people who are superior to you in their
desire for and understanding of it.</p>

<p>Companionship yields two kinds of impact: one that drags a person down
to the compost of the world and the other that points toward God, the
Exalted, and an existence that lasts forever. A companion who tries to
sell the ephemeral stuff of this life and makes it the substance of
conversation and pursuit is dragging the soul earthward. It is better,
beyond compare, to seek out the company of those who help one achieve
contentment with God. When one is content, little will suffice. But
without contentment, nothing suffices.</p>

<h4 id="seeking-refuge-with-god">Seeking refuge with God</h4>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d says that seeking refuge with God is the most
efficacious treatment for all diseases of the
heart. Sı̅dı̅ Ibn 'A̅shir says, "The only
real cure for all these diseases is to go to God with complete
unconditional imploring." What is meant here is urgently seeking
refuge in God's protection and guidance, to seek this as if one were
holding onto a thread over a canyon. It is begging, which before God
is honorable. There is nothing nonchalant in this act.</p>

<p>Imam Mawlu̅d says that one should be like a person drowning in
the sea or stranded in a desert without any provision. A moment of
desperation can often be the best thing that ever happens to a person.</p>

<hr />

<p>"None of you [fully] believes until his desires are in accordance with
what I have brought" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"For me to raise my hand from my plate while I am still hungry is
better than the whole night in prayer" (Imam al-Qushayrı̅).</p>

<p>"The disbeliever eats with seven intestines, while the believer eats
with one" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"Spread peace, feed needy people, and pray at night when others are
asleep, and you will enter Paradise with ease" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"Take the path of ease with yourself in order for you to progress in
your yearnings" (Shaykh al-Ḥabı̅b).</p>

<p>"A prayer performed with love is better than a thousand devoid of it"
(Shaykh al-Ḥabı̅b).</p>

<p>"Do not take as a companion someone whose state will not elevate you
and whose speech does not direct you to God" (Imam Ibn
'Aṭa̅'alla̅h).</p>

<p>"Anyone who tells you to indulge in the world is defrauding you"
(Sı̅dı̅ Abu̅ al-Ḥasan).</p>
