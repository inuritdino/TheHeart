## Introduction to Purification


### Courtesy: the Heart of Purification

[...] Imam Mawlud starts his treatise with courtesy, since excellent
behavior and comportment are the doorkeepers to the science of
spiritual purification. One must have courtesy with regard to
God---behave properly with respect to His presence---if he or she
wishes to purify the heart. But how does one achieve this courtesy?
Imam Mawlud mentions two requisite qualities associated with courtesy:
modesty (*haya'*) and humility (*dhul*).

*Haya'*, in Arabic, conveys the meaning of "shame", though the root
word of *haya'* is closely associated with "life" and "living." The
Prophet &#65018; stated, "Every religion has a quality that is
characteristic of that religion, and the characteristic of my religion
is *haya'*," an internal sense of shame that includes bashfulness and
modesty.

[...]

Some anthropologists divide cultures into shame cultures and guilt
cultures. According to this perspective, shame is an outward
mechanism, and guilt is an inward one which alludes to a human
mechanism that produces strong feelings of remorse when someone has
done something wrong, to the point that he or she needs to rectify the
matter.

Most primitive cultures are not guilt-based but are shame-based, which
is rooted in the fear of bringing shame upon oneself and the larger
family. Islam honors the concept of shame and takes it to another
level altogether---to a rank in which one feels a sense of shame
before God. When a person acknowledges and realizes that God is fully
aware of all that one does, says, and thinks, shame is elevated to a
higher plane, to the unseen world from which there is no cover[...]

Imam Mawlud also mentions that one should have *dhul*, which literally
means, "being lowly, abject, or humbled." The Qur'an mentions that
people who incur the anger of God have this state of humiliation
thrust upon them. This humility or humbleness assumed before God is
required for courtesy[...]

When we seriously reflect upon God's perfect watch over His creation
and the countless blessings He sends down, and then consider the kind
of deeds we bring before Him, what can we possibly feel except
humility and shame? These strong feelings should lead us to implore
God to change our state, make our desires consonant with His pleasure,
giving up our designs for God's designs. This is pure courtesy with
respect to God, a requisite for spiritual purification.

[...]

Imam Mawlud then says that one should hasten "to fulfill [God's]
command" and be "wary of the subtle encroachment of bad manners,"
namely, faults that one is unaware of. A hadith states, "One of you
will say a word and give it no consideration, though it will drag the
person [who utterd it] through Hellfire for 70 years." People often
become so disconnected from prophetic teachings that they unwittingly
inflict great harm upon themselves.

### Freedom and Purification

Imam Mawlud speaks next about freedom, which is achieved when one
realizes the qualities of shame and humility, and empties oneself of
their opposites (shamelessness and arrogance). With these qualities
come true freedom, wealth, and dignity, which require manumission from
the bonds of one's whims. People may claim to be "free," yet they
cannot control themselves from gluttony in the presence of food or
from illicit sexual relations when the opportunity presents
itself. Such a notion of freedom is devoid of substance.

Freedom has real meaning when, for example, a situation of temptation
arises and one remains God-fearing, steadfast, and in control of one's
actions. This holds true even when the temptation produces flickers of
desire in a person who nonetheless refrains from indulging. Imam
al-Ghazali speaks at length about the desires of our limbs and organs
and refers to the stomach and the genitals as being the two
"dominators"; if they are under control, all other aspects of desire
are kept in check. The tongue is also a formidable obstacle. There are
people, for example, who appear incapable of refraining from
backbiting and speaking ill of others, and they often do so without
realizing it.

It is common for people to dislike impoverishment or humility because
they perceive them as abjectness. Yet the Prophet &#65018; chose
poverty over wealth; he did not have money in his home; he did not
have jewelry; he slept on the floor upon a bed made of leather that
was stuffed with palm fibers; and he had two pillows in his room for
guests. In much of today's culture, living this way would be
considered extreme poverty. Imam Mawlud stresses that dignity with God
comes to those who are humble before Him, those who place prime value
on how they are received by their Maker and not by how they will be
judged by the ephemeral norms of people. Dignity and honor are gifts;
the Qur'an says about God, "*You exalt whomever You will, and You
debase whomever You will*" (3:26). Proofs of this divine law abound
[...]

Imam Mawlud goes on to explain that there is no salvation "like the
heart's salvation, given that all the limbs [and organs] respond to
its desires." If one's heart is safe, so too are the limbs and organs,
for they carry out the deeds inspired by the heart. The limbs and
organs of the corrupt become instruments through which corruption is
spread [...]

According to a hadith, the tongue is the "interpreter of the heart."
Hypocrisy is wretched because the hypocrite says with his tongue what
is not in his heart. He wrongs his tongue and oppresses his heart. But
if the heart is sound, the condition of the tongue follows suit. We
are commanded to be upright in our speech, which is a gauge of the
heart's state. According to a prophetic tradition, each morning, when
the limbs and organs awaken in the spiritual world, they shudder and
say to the tongue, "Feat God concerning us! For if you are upright,
then we are upright; and if you deviate, we too deviate." Engaging in
the regular remembrance of God (*dhikr*) safeguards the tongue and
replaces idle talk with words and phrases that raise one in honor. The
tongue is essential in developing courtesy with God, which is the
whole point of existence.

### The Purification Process

Purifying the heart is a process. First, one must understand the
necessity of having courtesy with God and the importance of fulfilling
its requirements, as noted above. Second, one must be aware of the
diseases of the heart---aware of their existence, their ailments, and
the deleterious complications and troubles that ensue from them, and
recognize that these diseases prevent one from attaining this
courtesy. Knowledge of the diseases of the heart, their causes, and
how to remove them is an obligation on every sane adult human being.

Imam Mawlud cites Imam al-Ghazali (an eleventh century master scholar
of the science of purification) holding the position that it is indeed
an obligation on everyone to learn about the ailments of the heart and
their cures. Imam Mawlud then states that some scholars hold that this
is not an obligation per se for everyone, particularly for a person
who has already been blessed with a sound heart and has been spared
these maladies. Imam al-Ghazali dissents and says that these disease
are inherent to the human condition. One can observe, for example,
greed, jealousy, hatred, and the like in children, though the diseases
do not necessarily endure [...]

It is interesting that Imam Mawlud says it is impossible to rid
oneself of these diseases completely. This implies that purification
is a lifelong process, not something that is applied once and then
forgotten. Purity of heart never survives a passive relationship. One
must always guard his or her heart.

There is a well-known hadith which states that every child is born in
the state of *fitrah* [...], which means that people are born inclined
to faith, with an intuitive awareness of divine purpose and a nature
built to receive the prophetic message. What remains then is to
nurture one's *fitrah* and cultivate this inclination to faith and
purity of heart.
