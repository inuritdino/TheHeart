<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>False hope is a "quick-acting poison" that produces an inordinate
    attachment to worldly concerns, which is a cause of so many
    diseases of the heart. This poison is extended hope
    (<i>tat&#803;w&#305;&#773;l al-'amal</i>), assuring oneself that
    death is a long way off&mdash;a mental environment that leads
    people to lead their daily lives as though a long life is
    guaranteed. The dangers of this delusion are self-evident.</p>
  <p>In some ways, extended hope is a necessary human condition (e.g.,
    planting orchards or having children). A famous Persian story
    speaks of a shah who passed by an old man planting an olive tree,
    which takes decades to produce good fruit. The shah asked, "Do you
    believe this tree will be of any benefit to you, old man? You will
    die before it bears fruit." The old man replied, "Those before me
    planted and we benefited. We should plant so that others after us
    might benefit." The shah was so impressed with the old man's
    concern for the future generations that he rewarded the old man
    with money. The old man then said to the shah, "You see! The tree
    has brought me benefit already." The shah smiled and rewarded him
    again.</p>
  <p>The extended hope that Imam Mawlu&#773;d calls a "poison" is akin
    to false hope that generates hardheartedness and indolence due to
    heedlessness of the Hereafter.</p>
  <p><b>Hoping for longer life</b></p>
  <p>Although extended hope can harden hearts, Imam Mawlu&#773;d says
    there are exceptions, like one who is "engaged in preparing for
    tomorrow or writing works." One is not blameworthy for dedicating
    years of work for a single end product, like a scholarly work from
    which many people may benefit. If is one of the highest things a
    person can do. It is, in fact, a form of perpetual charity
    (<i>s&#803;adaqah ja&#773;riyah</i>), whose reward accrues in
    favor of its progenitor, even after he or she has died. In cases
    like this, one is not censured for desiring a long life because
    one seeks to strive in ways that serve God, His religion, and
    humanity.</p>
  <p>The Prophet &#65018; warned against desiring death, for one
    "should desire life either to repent and make amends for past
    iniquities, or if one did much good, to increase his righteous
    deeds." There is so much optimism and hope in this statement of
    the Prophet &#65018;.</p>
  <p><b>Hope (<i>raja&#773;'</i>) and extended hope</b></p>
  <p>Imam al-Qara&#773;f&#305;&#773; differentiates between the hope
    inherent in the Arabic word <i>raja&#773;'</i> and the hope
    implied by <i>tat&#803;w&#305;&#773;l al-'amal</i>. The Qur'an
    praises one who hopes for God and meeting Him in the
    Hereafter. The Prophet &#65018; said, "It is natural to dislike
    death, but ultimately meeting God is something the believer seeks
    and looks forward to." This kind of hope is known
    as <i>raja&#773;'</i>. It is hope coupled with sincere effort to
    achieve what one hopes for.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
  <p>When one believes that he or she will live for a long time, what
    ensues is a diminution of pondering one's mortality as well as a
    sense of independence from God.</p>
  <p><b>Wretchedness</b></p>
  <p>Fud&#803;ayl ibn 'Iya&#773;d&#803;&mdash;a great early scholar
    and a man of asceticism&mdash;said that the world is divided into
    two types of people: felicitous (<i>sa'&#305;&#773;d</i>) and
    wretched (<i>shaq&#305;&#773;</i>). No third category exists. [He]
    said that there are well known signs of wretchedness. The first is
    having a hard heart. Scholars have said that if you want to know
    whether or not your heart is hard, then look at your eye. If it is
    dry and unmoved to tears, this is an indication of a hard heart. A
    person who has sympathy and softness in the heart is said to have
    a moistened eye.</p>
  <p>The second sign is a lack of modesty or shame.</p>
  <p>The third sign is coveting the world.</p>
  <p>The last sign of wretchedness is having extended hopes.</p>
  <p><b>Hardheartedness and indolence</b></p>
  <p>The indolence (as a result of extended hope) or sloth
    (<i>kasl</i>) shows itself in lassitude concerning matters of the
    Hereafter, such as fulfilling the obligatory acts of worship and
    other religious dictates.</p>
  <p>The Qur'an speaks of certain people who, after a long span of
    time, became hardhearted and ungodly (QUR'AN, 57:16). When a person
    suffers the passage of time without consistent and serious
    reflection about the Hereafter, the world takes hold of his heart
    more and more, which has a way of making it hard. Those who have
    hard hearts become corrupt. This dynamic applies to societies as
    it does for individuals.</p>

  <p><b>Hope and fear</b></p>
  <p>It was common among Muslim scholars to discuss the delicate
    balance between hope and fear. If one is overwhelmed with fear, he
    enters a psychological state of terror that leads to despair
    (<i>ya's</i>)&mdash;that is, despair of God's mercy.</p>
  <p>Nonetheless, an overabundance of hope is a disease that leads to
    complacency and dampens the aspiration to do good since salvation
    is something guaranteed (in one's mind, that is). Human beings
    simply cannot handle being assured of Paradise without deeds that
    warrant salvation. Too many will serve their passions like slaves
    and still consider themselves saved. In Islam, faith must be
    coupled with good works for one's religion to be complete.</p>
  <p><b>Empty wish (<i>umniyyah</i>)
  </b></p>
  <p>There is yet another kind of hope called <i>umniyyah</i>, which
    is blameworthy in Islam. Essentially, it is having hope but
    neglecting the means to achieve what one hopes for, which is often
    referred to as an "empty wish." One hopes to become healthier, for
    example, but remains sedentary and is altogether careless about
    diet. To hope for the Hereafter but do nothing for it in terms of
    conduct and morality is also false hope.
  </p>
  <p>Entry into Paradise is a matter of God's mercy, which is attained
    by combining faith with sincere deeds that confirm one's
    profession of faith. Unfortunately, on the Day of Judgment, many
    Muslims may find themselves in Hell because of false hopes. All
    they have to show for their religiosity is the mere declaration of
    faith, a testimony unconfirmed by deeds, especially the rites of
    worship and charitable acts toward others.</p>
  <p><b>Superstition (<i>tat&#803;ayyur</i>)
  </b></p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d mentions next the concept of divination and
    foreboding (<i>tat&#803;ayyur</i>). Foreboding is blatant
    superstition. The Imam says that superstition is lack of knowledge
    that everything belongs to God.</p>
  <p>There are two types of foreboding. One is based on normative
    experience: observing things that consistently happen (e.g.,
    running away from a cobra). There is no superstition in that. But
    this differs completely from some practices like avoiding walking
    under a ladder, staying clear of a black cat, and the culture that
    has evolved around the number 13. These superstitions emanate from
    having a bad opinion of God. Such superstitions are explicitly
    forbidden in Islam.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p><b>Hoping for longer life to do good and reflection on death</b></p>
  <p>People who recognize the urgency of the human condition and
    their own impending mortality do not squander their time. They set
    out doing good deeds, such as spreading knowledge, and this is
    entirely beneficial. Once, a great scholar who was a source of
    benefit for many people became very ill. A person came to him and
    asked him if he was fearful of dying. He said, "No! A verse of the
    Qur'an says that I will not die yet." The man asked, "Which
    verse?" He said, "<i>What benefits people shall continue on
    earth</i> (QUR'AN, 13:17). This kind of hope for a long life is a
    mercy from God, so that people who bring benefit to others will
    wish for more opportunity to taste the sweetness of being a
    harbinger of goodness.</p>
  <p>It is no coincidence that those very people who do good and who
    hope to do more of it are, in fact, those who reflect on death and
    work for the Hereafter the most, so that the Day of Judgment will be
    a moment of joy and light for them.</p>
  <p>Many of the righteous forebears of Muslim civilization stressed
    that one should visualize the states of death and the Afterlife:
    their bodies being washed and prepared for burial, being lowered
    into the grave, having soil cover them, being questioned by the
    angels, climbing out of the grave on the Day of Resurrection, and
    being called to stand in judgment before God, the
    Exalted. Spiritual masters have long said that if a person is
    struggling with his appetites, this exercise is a good way of
    controlling them. Reflection on death brings sobriety to one's
    state.</p>
  <p><b>Fear</b></p>
  <p>Fear (<i>khawf</i>) treats or prevents two maladies: moral
    complacency and self-righteousness. Having a good measure of fear
    is necessary to stay on the path. But when one reaches his or her
    deathbed, one should have absolute hope in God, and have certainty
    that God will offer forgiveness and allow him or her entrance into
    Paradise. This is having a good opinion of our Lord. The Prophet
    &#65018; warned that no one should die except with "a good opinion
    about God."</p>
  <p><b>Extended hope and reality of death</b></p>
  <p>Imam al-Haytham&#305;&#773; relates that having extended hope
    (<i>tat&#803;w&#305;&#773;l al-'amal</i>) is founded on
    heedlessness of the reality of death, which, he said, is not wrong
    in and of itself. There is no commandment that obliges the
    remembrance of death, although it is difficult to imagine a
    spiritual life without such reflection. The Prophet &#65018; said,
    "Remember death" and he said, "I used to tell you do not visit
    graves, now I tell you to visit graves because it will remind you
    of the Hereafter." Although these commands do not rise to the
    level of obligation, they are considered highly recommended
    (<i>mandu&#773;b</i>), the same way that the remembrance of God
    beyond what is prescribed is recommended but not obligatory per
    se.
  </p>
  <p>God loves those who spend their youth obedient to Him and His
    commandments.</p>
  <p><b>Superstition</b></p>
  <p>What the sacred law permits as a means to avoid calamities is not
    superstition. Saying certain prayers, reading certain passages of
    the Qur'an that ward off evil, giving extra charity, and the like
    are acts of worship. These are based on revelation from God
    Himself and, therefore, differ completely from pre-Islamic
    practices, such as avoiding coming between two sheep, which was
    considered bad luck. The Prophet &#65018; warned against
    superstition, no matter how widespread it may be in societies.</p>
  <p>According to Imam Mawlu&#773;d, the way to cure this trap of
    superstition is for one to simply persist in what one was doing
    before being confronted with whatever it is that is viewed as a bad
    omen. Altering one's course of action because of some perceived
    bad omen is admitting that the superstition has power. It is
    important to note that if it is not one's habit to have such bad
    forebodings and one finds oneself with a bad feeling about a
    situation or person, it is prudent to "listen to the heart". This
    is known as <i>fira&#773;sah</i> in Arabic, and in traditional
    theology is recognized simply as "discernment". It is an angelic
    agent that attempts to protect us from some imminent harm.
