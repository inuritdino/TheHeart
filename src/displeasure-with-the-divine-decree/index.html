  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <div class="poem">
    <p>Displeasure with the divine decree occurs when one resists</p>
    <p>God, the Majestic and Exalted, in what He has decreed.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
  <p>How many times have we heard a person bemoan, "I do not deserve
    this!" or "Why me?" or utter such similar statements? Many people
    live with rancor in their hearts because of what they have been
    dealt with in life. This attitude toward trials stems from a
    denial of God's omnipotence and that God alone decrees all
    things.</p>
  <p>God-conscious people, when asked about what their Lord has given
    them, say that all of it is good. They say this out of knowledge
    of the nature of this world, as a temporary crucible of trial and
    purification. Because of this elevated understanding, they are
    patient with afflictions and trials. For worldly people, there is
    only this world, and this understanding creates a blind spot to
    the wondrousness of God's creation and His signs strewn
    throughout.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>The four categories and appropriate treatment</h3>
  <p>There are only four possible states in which the human being can
    live, according to revealed sources. A person is either receiving
    blessings (<i>ni'mah</i>) or <i>tribulations</i>
    (<i>bala&#773;'</i>) from God; or is either living in obedience
    (<i>ta&#773;'ah</i>) to God or in <i>disobedience</i>
    (<i>ma's&#803;iyyah</i>). When God bestows blessings, the response
    should be gratitude in all of its manifestations. According to
    sacred law, gratitude is expressed first by performing what is
    obligatory (<i>wa&#773;jib</i>), and then going beyond that by
    performing virtuous, recommended (<i>mandu&#773;b</i>)
    acts. Gratitude is an awakening of appreciation in one's heart and
    an acknowledgement of what one has received. Abusing one's
    material assets (hoarding them without consideration of the needy
    or applying them toward forbidden matters) is a flagrant act of
    ingratitude.</p>
  <p>The response to tribulation is patience (<i>s&#803;abr</i>), as
    well as steadfastness and resolve. This is what God demands from
    people in times of trial&mdash;"a beautiful patience," as close as
    possible to what Jacob (peace be upon him) exhibited in response to
    the disappearance of his beloved son Joseph (peace be upon him)
    and the machinations of his other sons (QUR'AN, 12:18), or to the
    patience of Job (peace be upon him) during his afflictions.</p>
  <p>As for obedience, one must recognize that obedience is a blessing
    from God. If a religious person starts to believe that he is
    better than other people&mdash;even if these "other" people are in
    the state of disobedience&mdash;he invites haughtiness. This is
    the danger of obedience and, in fact, the danger of religion:
    self-righteousness. Imam Ibn 'At&#803;a&#773;'alla&#773;h said,
    "How many a wrong action that leads to a sense of shame and
    impoverishment before God is better than obedience that leads to
    sense of pride and arrogance!" In this is the secret of wrong
    actions. The New Testament relates the story of the pride of the
    righteous Pharisee and the contrition of the humble tax
    collector. Jesus (peace be upon him) remarks, "Those who make
    themselves great will be humbled, and those who humble themselves
    will be made great." Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q said that the
    goodness in obedience is in its essence, and the evil in obedience
    is what it can result in. This does not mean that there is evil in
    obedience and goodness in disobedience. Rather,
    S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q points out the
    danger of obedience creating vanity in one's heart, an aura of
    sanctimony and condescension. On the other hand, when one indulges
    in wrongdoing and is overcome with feelings of shame, this can
    inspire him to hasten to repentance. The Prophet &#65018; said
    that he feared for his people the vanity of self-righteousness.</p>
  <p>The Prophet &#65018; also said that whoever has a mustard seed of
    arrogance in his heart will not enter Heaven; this sentiment is
    shared with Christianity. What God asks from obedient people is
    simply acknowledging that their obedience is a gift from God [...]
    It is unbecoming for a believer to look with scorn at those in
    tribulation and exhibit a loathsome disdain toward others who seem
    misguided. It is far better to come with compassion toward them
    and gratitude to God. When the Prophet &#65018; saw people
    severely tried, he made the supplication: "Praise be to [God] who
    has given me wellbeing such that I was not tried like these
    people. And He has preferred me over so much of his creation."
    When the Prophet &#65018; witnessed people in tribulations, he
    responded with compassion for them and gratitude for
    wellbeing.</p>
  <p>When it comes to disobedience (<i>ma's&#803;iyyah</i>), the
    correct response is sincerely repenting to God (<i>tawbah</i>);
    seeking His forgiveness, pardon, and mercy; feeling remorse for
    past sins; and having the resolve never to sink into disobedience
    again.</p>
  <p>Everything that can happen to a person falls into one of these
    four categories, and each invites an appropriate response[...] Ibn
    'Abba&#773;s said that if a person is tested with a tribulation,
    he will find in it three blessings: firstly, the tribulation could
    have been worse; secondly, it was in worldly matters and not in
    spiritual ones; and thirdly, it came in the finite world and not
    in the infinite one. All these are reasons to thank God even for
    tribulations.</p>
  <h3>Displeasure is heedlessness</h3>
  <p>To be displeased at God's divine decree is to plunge into
    heedlessness (<i>ghaflah</i>). In his book <i>al-Furu&#773;q</i>,
    Imam al-Qara&#773;fi distinguishes the difference between a divine
    decree and being content with the decree itself. Should people be
    happy with all that comes their way, including the bad things? God
    has decreed that evil exist in the world in order to test
    humankind and for reasons that accord with His wisdom. We should
    not be displeased with His choice in allowing this. But when one
    sees societies plunged into immorality, it is not something to be
    pleased with or even to fell indifferent toward. On contrary, God
    requires that we dislike it. But never should we resent or be
    displeased with the fact that God has created a world wherein such
    things exist, however unpleasant they may be.</p>
</div>

<p>Imam Abu̅ Ḥasan said that there is a quality in people that
most are unaware of, yet it consumes good deeds: displeasure with
God's divine decree (<i>qadar</i>).</p>

<p>"Do not find fault in others. If you find fault in them, God may take
their faults away and give them to you" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>The Prophet ﷺ lived to see all of his children buried, except
for Fa̅ṭimah (peace be upon her). How many people
experience that in their lifetime? Out of six children, he saw five of
them perish. His father died before his birth. His mother died when he
was just a boy. His guardian grandfather then died. When he received
his calling, he saw his people turn against him with vehemence and
brutality. People who had once honored him now slandered him, calling
him a madman, liar, and sorcerer. They stalked him and threw stones
until he bled. They boycotted him and composed stinging invectives
against him. He lost his closest friends and relatives, like
Ḥamzah (may Allah be pleased with him). After 25 years of
blissful marriage, his beloved wife, Khadı̅jah (peace be
upon her), died during the Prophet's most trying times. Abu̅
T&amp;803;a̅lib, his protecting uncle, also died. The Prophet
ﷺ was the target of thirteen assassination attempts. How many
people have faced all of that? Not once in a single hadith is there a
complaint from him—except when beseeching his Lord.</p>

<p>Imam al-Qara̅fi gives the example of a physician who amputates
the arm of a patient who had gangrene spreading out of control. One
day, the physician overhears the patient complaining that the
physician was ignorant for amputating his arm. The physician is
offended, for he saved the man's life. Had the physician heard the
patient praising him—despite the fact that he lost an arm and is
discomforted by pain—the physician would feel compassion for the
man. So if one speaks about God's decree, saying, "God is testing me,
but it is His will and there is wisdom in it," this differs greatly
from the remarks of one who complains about the perceived injustices
in the world.</p>
