<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>In plain terms, it is showing off, doing something to gain
    notoriety. The Prophet &#65018; referred to this behavior as "the
    lesser idolatry." The most nefarious form of ostentation is when a
    person performs rites of worship merely to obtain a place in the
    hearts of others.</p>
  <p>The essence of ostentation is being occupied with people instead
    of God.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Three signs of ostentation</h3>
  <p>The first two are laziness and lack of action for the sake of God
    when one is alone and out of view of others. When alone, such a
    person becomes lethargic, unable (or unwilling) to perform acts of
    devotion, such as reading the Qur'an at home; but in the mosque,
    in the presence of others, he finds the drive to recite. This is
    not to suggest that one should not respond to the inspiration one
    receives when in the company of people who are doing good
    deeds...</p>
  <p>Another sign of ostentation is increasing one's actions when
    praised and decreasing them in the absence of such praise. In
    Islamic sacred law, encouragement is not censured.</p>
  <h3>Etiology</h3>
  <p>The root source of ostentation is desire, wanting something from
    a source other than God.</p>
  <h3>Some manifestations</h3>
  <p>Performing acts of worship in order to be entrusted with the
    wealth of an orphan and then misusing it for personal needs. This
    is hypocrisy, one of the most despised characteristics and most
    damnable.</p>
  <p>Ostentatious display of piety to take advantage of an endowment
    established for religious purposes and using it for something
    else. The same is true for any fundraising for religious
    objectives, which is diverted to other ends. The level of
    depravity in such fraud is staggering.</p>
  <p>A lesser form of ostentation is displaying good works to keep the
    scorn and criticism of others at bay.</p>
  <h3>Pleasure in worship</h3>
  <p>The Imam then speaks of a subtle matter involving people finding
    pleasure in worship, and how some people are motivated to worship
    for the purpose of seeking out this pleasure.</p>
  <p>There are people, who find this pleasure so compelling that they
    perform acts of worship for the sake of experiencing it. Some
    scholars warned against this. God has placed pleasure in rites of
    worship as a reward for their constant practice, for there is a
    blessing in worship, and seeking it out should not be belittled,
    since it is from God Himself.</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d mentions these various opinions[...], perhaps,
    to alert the worshipper of what people might say to one who
    seriously treads the road to finer and more meaningful worship of
    God.</p>
  <h3>Enjoying when people become aware of one's devotional acts</h3>
  <p>A person performs an act of worship for the sake of God but is
    pleased when he finds out that others have learned of it. Some
    scholars consider this ostentation. According to others, it is not
    ostentation as long as his intention when performing the act was
    sincerely for the sake of God.</p>
  <h3>Ostentation in scholars</h3>
  <p>Imam al-Jazu&#773;l&#305;&#773; warns that if a person reads
    something and comes across some abstruse matter, and thinking it
    would be good to mention in public, he writes it down or memorizes
    it, with intention of preparing for the grand moment to unleash
    this newfound knowledge before people&mdash;this is
    ostentation. Scholars in particular are in danger of this kind of
    ostentation.</p>
  <p>Exceptions: when a worshipper sees that people have abandoned
    good actions, and so he does them publicly as a way of admonition
    and as a reminder. For instance, Ibn 'Umar and Ibn Mas'u&#773;d
    were known to go to the mosque before dawn in order to perform the
    night vigil prayer (<i>tahajjud</i>) [...] to encourage others to
    do the same.</p>
  <h3>Fear of ostentation</h3>
  <p>Abandoning a good act out of fear of ostentation is worse than
    engaging in ostentation itself.</p>
  <p>Engaging in remembrance of God (<i>dhikr</i>) with one's tongue,
    even if the heart is heedless, is better than abandoning it
    altogether. What a person repeats on his tongue might eventually
    reach the heart, even if the heart is not yet engaged, for the
    heart of man lies under his tongue.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>The Imam says that the cure for ostentation is the same as the
    cure for reckless compromise (<i>muda&#773;hana</i>,
    see <a href="../fear-of-poverty/">Fear of Poverty</a>). It is to
    actively and sincerely seek purification of the heart by removing
    four things: love of praise; fear of blame; desire for worldly
    benefit from people; and fear of harm from people. This is
    accomplished by nurturing the certainty (<i>yaq&#305;&#773;n</i>)
    that only God can benefit or harm one. This is the essence of the
    Islamic creed.</p>
  <p>Traditionally in the Muslim world, knowledge was the spiritual
    wealth people wanted to be associated with, not material
    wealth. It is a remarkable fact about the Muslim world that there
    were impoverished scholars who achieved great status in the world
    solely because of their knowledge. Sadly, such is often no longer
    the case.</p>
  <p>God's will cannot be thwarted. Only He possesses the dominion of
    the heavens and the earth, and only He recompenses people for
    their actions "in the two abodes," this world and the Hereafter.</p>
  <h3>Theoretical treatment</h3>
  <p>A showoff is invariably discovered, humiliated, and then
    scorned. And ultimately, he is bankrupt because insincerity is not
    acceptable to God.</p>
  <h3>Practical treatment</h3>
  <p>Intentional veiling of one's actions from the eyes of
    people. This way, one's intentions are protected from vanity. This
    does not mean that one should never perform deeds in front of
    people, but that one should also do them when others are not
    watching. Each person is the shepherd of his or her own heart. The
    night prayer vigil (<i>tahajjud</i>), engaging in <i>dhikr</i>
    litanies (remembrance of God), reciting Qur'an, and the like are
    excellent works to perform in privacy.</p>
  <p>It is recommended to recite often Sura al-Ikhla&#773;s&#803; (the
    112th sura of the Qur'an), which affirms the oneness of God and
    negates the possibility of there being anything comparable to
    Him. The Arabic word for "sincerity," <i>ikhla&#773;s&#803;</i>,
    comes from the root <i>khalus&#803;a</i>, which means "to be
    pure", as in pure honey or pure milk. As for one's piety, it can
    never be pure unless free of ostentation. In the Qur'an, there are
    two words that point to sincerity: <i>mukhlis&#803;</i>
    and <i>mukhlas&#803;</i>. The latter is the [passive] participle,
    which indicates that the agent of purification is external; that
    is, it is a blessing from God. Imam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, a
    thirteenth century scholar, said that it is possible for anyone to
    have sincerity in what one does and in what one believes,
    irrespective of creed. However, being <i>mukhlas&#803;</i>,
    purified by God, is reserved for those who have a system of belief
    and deeds that are concordant with what God has revealed. God
    loves this kind of human being. Imam Abu al-H&#803;asan
    al-Sha&#773;dhil&#305;&#773;, a thirteenth century scholar, once
    prayed, "O God, make my bad actions the bad actions of those whom
    You love, and do not make my good actions the good actions of
    those with whom You are displeased"</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d recommends that one repeat regularly a
    beautiful supplication of the Prophet &#65018;, known as <i>sayyid
    al-istighfa&#773;r</i> (the master supplication for
    forgiveness). The Prophet &#65018; said, "Whoever says this when
    he arises in the morning and [again] in the evening and then dies
    either that day or that evening will enter the Garden."</p>

<p>"I do not fear that you will worship the sun, the stars, and the moon,
but I fear your worshipping other than God through ostentation" (The
Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"What I fear most for my community is doing things for other than the
sake of God" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"When a believer hears somebody praising him, his faith
[<i>ima̅n</i>] increases" [not his pride] (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"If the kings knew the pleasure we are in, they would send their
armies with swords to take it away from us" (Imam Abu̅
Ḥanı̅fah).</p>

<p>"Whoever loves to do something and loves to be known for it has
committed idolatry [<i>shirk</i>]" (Aḥmad ibn Abı̅
al-Ḥawa̅rı̅).</p>

<p>"Whoever desires people to know what is between him and his Lord is in
a state of heedlessness" (Sa'd ibn 'Abd Alla̅h).</p>
