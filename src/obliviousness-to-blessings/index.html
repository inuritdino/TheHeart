<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Oblivion of blessings is a lack of understanding and
    acknowledgement, and noxious disregard that "<i>whatever blessings
    you have are from God</i>" (QUR'AN, 16:53). The blessings that
    come to us, night and day, are beyond numeration, as the Qur'an
    reminds. These blessings come in all forms&mdash;what we can see
    and touch (by way of material goods: food, clothing, shelter,
    wealth, and the like), as well as what we cannot see (such as
    safety, friendship, love, health, and protection from harm and
    calamity).
  </p>
  <p>The Qur'an begins with the phrase translated as, "<i>In the name
    of God, the Merciful, the Mercy-Giving</i>" (QUR'AN,
    1:1). According to some scholars, "Merciful"
    (<i>rah&#803;ma&#773;n</i>) refers to the Giver of the major
    blessings, while "Mercy-Giving" (<i>rah&#305;&#773;m</i>) implies
    the Giver of subtle blessings, which are not perceived until they
    are removed. For example, we blink thousands of times in a day
    without thought. There are people, however, who require artificial
    lubrication because their tear glands do not function.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
  <p><i>Istidra&#773;j</i> is God's allowing an ingrate to flaunt his
    blessings and not diminishing the ingrate's blessings in the
    least. In fact, God may even increase that blessing. The ingrate
    is then deluded into thinking that God really loves him or her,
    and the only thing worse than a misguided person is the person who
    is astray but believes himself to be favored by God.</p>
  <p>"<i>As for man, whenever his Lord tries him by honoring him and
      bestowing favors on him, he says, 'My Lord has honored me.' And
      whenever He tries him by restricting his provision, he says, 'My
      Lord has humiliated me'</i>" (QUR'AN, 89:15&ndash;16). Qur'anic
      commentators say that this passage shows the confusion of people
      in the way they interpret the blessings they receive. When they
      are the recipients of great wealth, they see themselves as
      especially pleasing to God. And when their provision is
      restricted, they feel God is debasing them. However, people
      often miss the reality that wealth is a test from God to see if
      its recipient will be generous or miserly. The same applied when
      wealth is restricted: Will a person be patient and content or
      feel despair and bitterness?</p>
  <p>Certain qualities benefit a person in the short and long term,
    such as knowledge and excellent character. Similarly, certain
    characteristics harm a person immediately and in the long run,
    such as ignorance and obnoxiousness. Furthermore, some actions
    offer immediate gratification, but the long-term benefits are
    nil. Carnal desires (<i>shahawa&#773;t</i>) are generally of this
    type. If a person overeats, he experiences immediate
    gratification; but in the long-term, doing so invites health
    problems. This is also true with sexual intimacy: being patient
    until marriage may be uncomfortable and even frustrating, but its
    benefit is far greater than any temporary pleasure attained in
    falling into sin.</p>
  <p>Those who are ignorant see only short-term relief as a blessing
    and disregard the benefits of patience and temporary
    discomfort. On the other hand, knowledge opens the eyes to the
    long-term benefits, which last forever.</p>
  <p>Intelligence is linked to morality, as to be moral one must be
    willing to put off a short-term gain for a long-term benefit that
    ultimately is greater and everlasting. This kind of intelligence
    is conditioned by Islam.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>While we cannot count our blessings, we are commanded to be
    grateful for them.
  </p>
  <p>The fact that the Qur'an has been revealed to tell us to reflect
    on these blessings is in itself a great blessing, for, without
    guidance, the human being cannot on his own determine out how to
    live. To deny God's blessings can lead to outright disbelief and
    denial of God, the Exalted.</p>
  <p>God will not take away a blessing unless people show
    ingratitude. Gratitude to God protects one from having blessings
    removed.</p>
  <p>The Prophet &#65018; once asked a man, "Do you know what the
    completion of a blessing is?" The Prophet &#65018; told him,
    "Entering Paradise." Faith, patience, good character, swiftness in
    doing good, and promptness in worship are blessings from God, and
    they are everlasting. Islam itself is the completion of God's
    blessings upon humanity: "<i>This day, I have perfected for you
    your religion, and I have completed My blessings upon you, and I
    have chosen Islam for you as your religion</i>" (QUR'AN, 5:3).</p>
  <p>The ornaments of this life include houses, furnishings, clothing,
    and the like. The more one acquires of these blessings, the more
    he will be accountable for. The Prophet &#65018; said that the
    meat, dates, and cool water that we consume are of those things we
    will be asked about, even the sandals on our feet.</p>
  <p>To be <i>za&#773;hid</i> (ascetic) does not always mean a lack of
    material possession. There is asceticism of the heart, in which
    one is not attached to the material world and is indifferent to
    it. In other words, a person's character and level of faith will
    not change if he loses his wealth. That is the sign of
    a <i>za&#773;hid</i>. However, if one falls apart and plunges into
    despondency when losing something valuable, it shows an inordinate
    attachment to worldly life.</p>
</div>

<p>"<i>So let man reflect on the food he eats. Indeed, We have poured
down water in showers. Then We split the land in clefts. Then We
caused to grow grain therein, and grapes and fresh herbage, and olive
trees and date palms, and dense orchards and fruits and
pasture—all provision for you and for your cattle</i>" (QUR'AN,
80:24–32).</p>

<p>"<i>God never changes any blessing He has bestowed upon a people until
  they first change what is in themselves</i>" (QUR'AN, 8:53).</p>

<p>"If you have a blessing, guard it, for disobedience shall snatch it
away" (A poet).</p>

<p>"We are a people to whom God has given dignity with Islam; but if we
seek dignity elsewhere, God will humiliate us" (Sayyiduna̅ 'Umar,
may God be pleased with him).</p>
