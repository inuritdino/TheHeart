<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Intense anger or wrath (<i>ghad&#803;ab</i>) aptly compares with
    a swelling mass of emotion (a "swelling ocean") that is difficult
    to hold back once it is unleashed. According to a hadith, a man
    asked the Prophet &#65018;, "What is the worst thing that one
    incurs concerning God?" The Prophet &#65018; replied, "His wrath."
    The man then asked, "How do we avoid it?" The prophet &#65018;
    said, "Do not become angry."
  </p>
  <p>Scholars agree that anger is not prohibited categorically, for
    even the Messenger of God &#65018; became angry when
    appropriate. But his anger was always in response to an aberration
    in human character and behavior offensive to God. So anger is not
    necessarily a negative emotion in and of itself. Anger can be a
    positive motivator.</p>
  <p>However, there is another side to anger that we must guard
    against. If it is not guided to something useful, it can possess,
    consume, and ultimately destroy a person.</p>
  <p>According to scholars, like Imam Al-Nawaw&#305;&#773; when the
    Messenger of God &#65018; said, "Do not become angry," he meant do
    not allow anger to lord over oneself and cause the loss of one's
    comportment. In other words, do not become anger, its embodiment,
    such that people only see your rage. Instead, control anger and
    never lose control.</p>
  <p>Without anger, people would go around with complete impunity and
    commit heinous acts without resistance from the people.</p>
  <p><b>Four essential qualities</b></p>
  <p>Muslim scholars have identified four essential qualities in human
    beings: <i>quwwat al-'ilm</i> (rational soul, capacity to
    learn), <i>quwwat al-ghad&#803;ab</i> (irascible soul, relating to
    human emotion and anger), <i>quwwat al-shahwah</i> (concupiscent
    soul, related to appetite and desire), and <i>quwwat al-'adl</i>
    (power of justice, that harmonizes the previous three and keeps
    them in balance). In Western tradition, these capacities
    correspond to what is known as cardinal virtues (<i>ummaha&#773;t
    al-fad&#803;a&#773;'il</i>): wisdom, courage, temperance, and
    justice.
  </p>
  <p>When the rational soul is balanced, the result is wisdom. Courage
    manifests when the irascible soul&mdash;anger&mdash;is under
    control, when a mean is struck between impetuousness and
    cowardice. Temperance is a balance within the concupiscent
    soul.</p>
  <p>With regard to anger, Imam al-Ghaza&#773;l&#305;&#773; says that
    it is acceptable only at the right time, in the right place, for
    the right reason, and with the right intensity. The Messenger of
    God &#65018; never allowed his anger to get the best of him. Out
    of the thousands of reports about the minutest details of the
    Prophet's life &#65018;, never has anyone related that the Prophet
    &#65018; ever did anything that was imprudent or rash. Never did
    he apply his intellectual gifts and prophetic status for anything
    other than guiding humanity aright.</p>
  <p>Qadi Ibn al-'Arab&#305;&#773; said that after the Messenger of
    God &#65018;, no one was more courageous than Abu&#773; Bakr (may
    God be pleased with him). 'Umar ibn al-Khat&#803;t&#803;a&#773;b
    (may God be pleased with him) is associated with being
    particularly sensitive to justice and fairness. 'Uthman ibn
    'Affa&#773;n's name is derived from the same Arabic root
    as <i>'iffah</i>, which refers not only to moderation but also to
    one who is abstinent and chaste, a meaning that is fitting for
    'Uthman. In 'Al&#305;&#773; ibn Ab&#305;&#773; T&#803;a&#773;lib,
    there is extraordinary wisdom or <i>h&#803;ikmah</i>. It is true
    that these great heroes of Islamic civilization embodied in a
    particular way one of the four virtues, but they also kept a
    balance that enshrined the rest.
  </p>
  <p>The cardinal virtues originally stem from religion. A generous
    person gives from his wealth to others because he is not afraid of
    losing his power or wealth; he knows all power and wealth are with
    God. All further virtues emanate from the cardinal virtues (or
    matrices of virtues). Mercy, for example, issues from wisdom
    (<i>h&#803;ikmah</i>), since forgiving someone when you are
    wronged required a recognition of the greater wisdom in remission
    and the greater good in clemency.
  </p>
  <p><b>Four reasons people get angry</b></p>
  <p>There are basically four reasons people get angry. One is related
    to primal needs, such as food, shelter, and life. When these are
    threatened, a normal person feels vulnerable and responds with
    anger. If someone threatens one's life or family, the person needs
    to respond. This anger is not blameworthy.</p>
  <p>The second reason is related to position, dignity, and protecting
    one's honor. Human beings are born with sensors that detect when
    others try to belittle them or when they are the object of
    contempt and scorn.</p>
  <p>The third cause of anger is related to specific people and their
    particular sense of values. If, for example, a scholar sees that a
    book is being abused, he will become angry. An illiterate farmhand
    may not be vexed about the abuse of a book, though he may curse a
    man who breaks a pitchfork.</p>
  <p>Finally, the fourth cause is <i>ghayrah</i>, commonly translated
    as jealousy. The Prophet &#65018; said that he himself had this
    type of protective jealousy: a sense of guarding what he held as
    dear. God has placed jealousy as part of human nature. For
    example, if men did not have jealousy about their wives,
    relationships would fall into dissolution. It is natural for a man
    to have this protective sense of jealousy regarding his wife.
  </p>
  <p>With regard to these causes of anger, Imam
    al-Ghaza&#773;l&#305;&#773; says that the first kind is healthy as
    long as it is not taken to an extreme, such as a person stealing
    from others in order to secure food and shelter. The second kind
    is also healthy, with the caveat of avoiding two extremes,
    haughtiness and abject humiliation.</p>
  <p>According to S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q,
    if ignorant people say something disparaging that does not relate
    to religion, then ignore it. One should not grow angry when there
    is no benefit in doing so. The Prophet &#65018; praised a man
    named Abu&#773; Damdam who never became angry when people spoke
    ill of him, for when one speaks ill of another, the speaker not
    only acquires misdeeds, but his own good deeds transfer to the
    account of the victim.</p>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
  <p><b><i>S&#803;ira&#773;t&#803; al-mustaq&#305;&#773;m</i>
  </b></p>
  <p>The phrase <i>s&#803;ra&#773;t&#803; al-mustaq&#305;&#773;m</i>,
    the straight or upright path, is repeated many time each day by
    the Muslim worshipper. No phrase better epitomizes the way of life
    of the Muslim. The word <i>mustaq&#305;&#773;m</i> suggests
    balance. If one deviates from this balanced path, he does so in
    one of two ways; deficiency in fulfilling one's obligations and
    excessiveness therein [...] When one is unable to keep up with
    certain practices, one becomes either worn out or altogether
    jaded, and this is antithetical to the straight path of
    Islam. Balance, then, is not merely a merciful device for
    adherents, but the shortest distance between a person and his or
    her spiritual objectives.
  </p>
  <p>The objectives of the rites of worship and practices cannot
    exceed what is natural. Sexual attraction, like hunger, cannot be
    removed from the soul; nor is it to one's benefit to try to do
    so. Celibacy is not considered a virtue in Islam. Chastity and
    licit sexual intimacy are. Church history tells of the Puritans
    who went so far as to swear off normal desires, such that sexual
    relations were nearly tabooed between a man and his wife [...] The
    usual result of excessiveness is its antithesis. A society that
    starts out with extreme Puritanical ethics may turn into one of
    over-indulgence and licentiousness[...] The Qur'an itself calls
    the believers a "middle nation," which commentators say includes
    moderation, which leads to a consistency of worship and conduct
    that one can carry on throughout his or her life.</p>
  <p>The Judaic legal tradition is based on stern justice, while at
    the foundation of the Christian phenomena is the idea of
    categorical mercy. With Islam a balance is struck suitable for the
    complex societies that have spread across the face of the earth, a
    balance between avoiding God's <i>ghad&#803;ab</i> (wrath and
    stern justice) and hoping for God's <i>rah&#803;mah</i>
    (mercy). To take the straight way, one must have both, the law and
    the spirit of the law, the <i>shar&#305;&#773;'ah</i> and
    the <i>h&#803;aq&#305;&#773;qah</i>. The law consists of rules,
    and the spirit of the law is mercy. God sent down the shariah as a
    mercy, and the Prophet &#65018; is "a <i>mercy to the worlds</i>"
    (QUR'AN, 21:107).
  </p>
  <p>There is an inward and outward state in every human soul, with
    the inward being <i>ima&#773;n</i> (the condition of the faith)
    and the outward being <i>isla&#773;m</i> (the manifestation or
    practice of the faith). When the two come together inwardly and
    outwardly, the resulting balance is a truly beautiful human being,
    one generally called a <i>muh&#803;sin</i>, one whose worship and
    character are excellent. According to Ibn al-Taym&#305;&#773;yyah,
    Muslims can deviate by way of striving to avoid
    God's <i>ghad&#803;ab</i> or by way of seeking
    His <i>rah&#803;mah</i>. They may go the way of hairsplitting,
    tyrannical scholar who condemns practically everyone and every
    act, or the way of the ignorant worshipper, as in extreme Sufism,
    which concludes that all is one and that everybody is going to
    Paradise, regardless of one's creed, one's disfigurement of God's
    revelations, and one's outright fabrications about God and His
    nature.
  </p>
  <p>The balance is to cling outwardly to the law and carry the spirit
    of Sufism inwardly, as Imam al-Sha&#773;fi'&#305;&#773;
    advised. When Muslims deal with one another, they should incline
    toward clemency and mercy, not wrath and severity. God says that
    the former is closer to <i>taqwah</i> (God-consciousness) than the
    latter (QUR'AN, 5:8). It is a more elevated act to reprieve than
    it is to exact justice. When love is present and is allowed to
    override one's anger, the demand for retribution is quieted
    (according to Imam Ra&#773;ghib al-Isfaha&#773;n&#305;&#773;).
  </p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>As for the spiritual disease of anger that consumes a person,
    Imam Mawlu&#773;d says there are two cures. One of them removes
    anger when it occurs, and the second suppresses or thwarts it. The
    first cure is to remember the extensive praise and goodness
    associated with forbearance and
    humility. S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q
    contends that the main reason people become angry is because the
    have inflated egos.</p>
  <p>The ethic promoted here is to simply "let go" and not allow
    insult to penetrate and manipulate one's emotion. It is about
    maintaining control over one's own emotions, feeling secure. One
    should remember how much God, the Exalted, praises the qualities
    of humility and forbearance. One should race to attain the
    qualities and behaviors that the Best of those who praise, the
    Maker of the heavens and the earth, commends.</p>
  <p>Humility and forbearance are praised in poetry and by all the
    different sages, even outside the religion of Islam. The Prophet
    &#65018; said that God elevates a person who is humble for the
    sake of God; but whoever tries to exalt himself, God debases
    him. The Prophet &#65018; was the most forbearing and forgiving of
    people. All the prophets were characterized by these
    qualities. None was known to be arrogant or easily angered.</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d states next that one can control anger by
    recognizing that nothing takes place without God's leave: There is
    no power or might except with God. This life is a crucible of
    trial, and those who are heedless of this react severely when
    trials come upon them. The Prophet &#65018; said the strong man is
    not one who can wrestle people, but the man who controls himself
    when he is angry.</p>
  <p>The Prophet &#65018; also advised that if one becomes angry, one
    should sit down. And if one is sitting, then one should
    recline. If neither of these helps, then one should perform the
    ritual ablution (<i>wud&#803;u&#773;'</i>) and then pray. Anger
    can be entirely irrational and require nothing more than a change
    of posture to reconstitute the mind. The Prophet's counsel is very
    telling of human nature; he reveals insights into the ebb and flow
    of human emotions and the ease with which we can alter our
    emotional condition. It is said that one of the ruses of Satan is
    to make what is easy appear difficult or even impossible; he
    whispers feelings of despair to make us grow despondent of God's
    mercy and thus surrender ourselves to the insidious view that we
    can never repent.</p>
</div>

<p>"When love exists, there is no need for justice" (Imam Ra̅ghib
al-Isfaha̅nı̅)</p>

<p>"The believer does not humiliate himself" (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>
