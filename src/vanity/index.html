<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Vanity is known in Arabic as <i>'ujb</i>, which is related to
    arrogance. According to Imam al-Ghaza&#773;l&#305;&#773;,
    arrogance requires two people for its outward manifestation: the
    arrogant one and the one to whom the arrogance is shown. The
    possessor of vanity, on the other hand, does not need a second
    person, as he is impressed with himself; he admires his own
    talents, possessions, looks, and status, and he considers himself
    better than others. He exults, for example, when looking at
    himself in the mirror or gazing upon his accomplishments or
    property. Imam Mawlu&#773;d says <i>'ujb</i> is a nefarious kind
    of vanity in which a person rejoices in the blessings he has but
    forgets the source of these blessings.
  </p>
  <p>The word "vanity" comes from the Latin word <i>vanus</i>, which
    means "empty," implying that the source of our vanity is void of
    substance and will vanish.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Origins</h3>
  <p>Vanity originates from one's ignorance of two matters: God alone
    is the Fashioner and the Giver of Blessings, and we human beings
    are incapable of accomplishing anything without God's will and
    blessings.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>The fact that someone has talent and is able to develop it into a
    higher skill or craft and achieve remarkable things does nothing
    to diminish the obvious&mdash;it still is a gift from God. It is
    part of the sunnah of God in creation, that divine order woven in
    the fabric of existence, that one must toil to refine his or her
    skills or talent. It is God who is the bestower of success and
    talent.</p>
  <p>In reality, God is the creator of the marvels that people admire
    and attribute to the glory of humankind, forgetting that it is God
    who created the ones who produced these marvels. Realizing that
    God is the source of all blessings prevents vanity from entering
    the heart.</p>
  <p>A person will always find someone with more talent and more
    knowledge.</p>
  <p>There is foolishness in being vain about what one has
    accomplished, given its ephemeral nature. But when one is thankful
    to God and acknowledges and praises Him as the source of this
    goodness, then the accomplishment outlasts our earthly lives and
    memories of people, for God preserves it.</p>
  <p>If one accomplishes something, one should remember God and be
    grateful, and not swagger with haughtiness, for if we do not
    humble ourselves, God will humble us.</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d says that to rid oneself of vanity or to
    prevent it from entering one's heart, one should reflect long and
    hard on the fact that all blessings are entirely from God and that
    one cannot produce any benefit or harm without His permission.</p>
</div>

<p>"God makes every maker and what he makes" (The Prophet ﷺ, from
Imam al-Bayhaqı̅).</p>

<p>"<em>Above all those who have knowledge is the All-Knowing</em>" (QUR'AN,
12:76).</p>

<p>When the Roman emperor triumphed in a battle, he put on a victory
celebration in which the general of the battle paraded through the
street. Behind him on his chariot a slave would hold a victory laurel
and whisper in the general's ear, "All is vanity," thus reminding the
general of the perils of vanity.</p>

<p>"O God, as You have made my countenance most excellent, make my
character most excellent" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>
