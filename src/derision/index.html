<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Derision is ridiculing people, making jest at their
    expense. Moses (peace be upon him) told his people that God had
    commanded them to sacrifice a cow. They replied, "Are you mocking
    us?" Moses (peace be upon him) then told them, "<i>I seek refuge
    in God from being ignorant</i>" (QUR'AN, 2:67). Hence, mocking
    people is a form of ignorance, whether it is lampooning,
    caricaturing, or name-calling. Humor and levity are important in
    human life. But levity as a way of life harms the spiritual
    heart. Furthermore, laughter and amusement at the expense of the
    dignity of others is wholly inappropriate, although it is the
    staple of the comedians of our day.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d says that the cure for the psychology and
    practice of mockery is similar to that of arrogance, since a
    person who mocks another most likely sees himself as superior to
    his victim. 'Al&#305;&#773; ibn Ab&#305;&#773; T&#803;a&#773;lib
    said, "Do not belittle anyone, for he may be a saint of God." Even
    if one sees a man inebriated and bellicose, vomiting in the
    street, one should not ridicule him, for one does not know what
    his future holds. Imam al-Qurt&#803;ub&#305;&#773; said, "When he
    was bowing down to idols in Mecca, 'Umar ibn
    al-Khat&#803;t&#803;a&#773;b was still beloved to God." Only God
    knows the seal of people and their destinies.
  </p>
  <p>God also commanded, "<i>Do not revile those who call upon others
    apart from God, for they may then revile God out of ignorance</i>"
    (QUR'AN, 6:108). This Qur'anic ethic guards against inciting
    people to do things that are sacrilegious and harmful to their own
    souls, for if people start to curse God, the Exalted, they invite
    the worse kind of harm. Even in the context of triumph, being
    boastful and exulting is ignoble. The Prophet &#65018; was never
    boastful when victorious. He was completely magnanimous and
    grateful to God, the Exalted. When he entered Mecca, his beloved,
    city, during the final conquest, he entered it with his head bowed
    and granted clemency to its inhabitants event though they had
    tortured, mocked, and reviled him. He exemplified complete beauty
    in character rooted in compassion and mercy.</p>
  <p>Supplicating God against one's enemies is not forbidden; in fact,
    it is recommended that people ask for victory when being attacked
    or occupied.</p>
  <p>People can be transformed. The opponents of the Prophet &#65018;
    were particularly vicious against Muslims. Hind actually bit into
    the liver of the Prophet's uncle, H&#803;amzah, when he was
    martyred at the Battle of Uh&#803;ud. However, she later became
    Muslim, and hence became a Companion of the Prophet &#65018;, a
    member of that special generation of humanity. Repentance is a
    recourse that the Lord of the Worlds has given humanity.</p>
  <p>Reflecting on the ethic that the Qur'an communicates to us in the
    aforementioned passages reveals that there is strength in dealing
    nobly with people. It is simply a better way to live. The
    treatment for derision is to realize that the essence of mockery
    is to humiliate people. Those who mock people in this life shall
    be mocked in the Hereafter, for it is a divine law that God
    recompenses people with the like of what they have done.</p>
</div>

<p>"Never mock any creature of God, for it might be beloved to He who
created it" (a Moroccan proverb).</p>

<p>"<i>O you who believe, do not let people mock another people; for it
may be that these are better than them; nor should women mock other
women, for ti may be that these are better than them. And do not taunt
one another nor insult each other with nicknames</i>" (QUR'AN, 49:11).</p>
