<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Antipathy toward death refers to strong aversion to death to the
    point that its mere mention causes consternation. Such a person,
    Imam Mawlu&#773;d says, is in denial of the reality. God says,
    "<i>Every soul shall taste death</i>" (QUR'AN, 3:185). None of
    this suggests that one should leap into the throes of death. It
    merely disparages the ethic of chasing after the fleeting things
    of this world while rebuffing the imminence of death and what
    comes thereafter. Nowadays, death is usually considered a morbid
    topic that is uncouth to discuss. And when it is discussed, it
    is often turned into some deadline before which people are
    supposed to squeeze in all their life's pleasures. The Muslim's
    view should be completely different. To speak about death is to
    speak about life and the urgency to live a faithful and
    wholesome life before death overtakes us.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
  <p>In Islam, the mourning period is short and should not be
    prolonged. The irony of extending the mourning period is that
    doing so is rooted in excessive love of <i>dunya&#773;</i> (the
    world). The more one covets this world, the greater the sense of
    loss when a loved one dies.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>For the believer, there is comfort in death, for the believer is
    taken from an abode of difficulty and trial to one of peace and
    unfathomable freedom.</p>
  <p>Everyone experiences the loss of a loved one. When the Prophet
    &#65018; lost his son Ibra&#773;h&#305;&#773;m, he wept but also
    praised God, the source of life and death. People who have
    strong faith in God and in the afterlife tend to handle death
    well and also handle calamities and tribulations well.</p>
  <p>The fear of death is natural. One reflexively protects himself
    from it. The Prophet &#65018; encouraged believers to desire a
    long life for two reasons: to make up for past iniquities or to
    increase good deeds.</p>
  <p>The one who remembers death is ennobled by certain
    characteristics, which include contentment and a lack of
    covetousness. The wealthy soul is one that is content. This
    contentment is not the kind that originates from stupidity or
    not knowing any better. It is contentment that is informed by
    knowledge and by reflection on death and its meaning.</p>
  <p>Second, the remembrance of death gives one energy to achieve good
    deeds.</p>
  <p>Third, remembrance of death engenders seeking repentance when one
    slips or errs. Penitence rectifies wrong action, and that is the
    gift of remembering death. When one lives with this realization,
    he or she becomes prompt in seeking God's forgiveness. Those who
    are heedless of death often have no compunction in doing wrong,
    since death is not a factor in their lives. They often
    carelessly view the Day of Judgment as some distant event hardly
    worth worrying about or some ancient notion formed in a
    primordial epoch of human development.</p>
</div>

<p>"In death there are a thousand reposes for the Muslim. As long as you
are in this world, there is not a cell in your body that does
not experience pain and disease. Once you are out of this world,
all of that ends" (Shaykh Ibn al-Ḥabı̅b).</p>

<p>"Contentment is a treasure that is never exhausted" (The Prophet
ﷺ).</p>

<p>"O God, provide for my family with what suffices them, and grant them
contentment with it" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>
