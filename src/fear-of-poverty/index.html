<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Nurturing fear of poverty is tantamount to harboring a negative
    opinion about God.</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d ties "fear of poverty" with a kindred illness
    whose carrier is called <i>muda&#773;hin</i> in Arabic; it is a
    person who uses his religion as a means of buttressing his worldly
    condition.</p>
  <p><i>Muda&#773;hana</i> is from the root of word <i>duhun</i>,
    which means, "to cover something up with paint or cosmetics."
    Shaykh Muhammad al-Yada&#773;l&#305;&#773;&#305;&#773; says
    that <i>muda&#773;hana</i> is when a man "gives up his religion in
    order to secure his wealth or his blood, sitting with the people
    of disobedience, keeping their company, praising their actions,
    and displaying pleasure at their condition without condemnation."
    In our modern context, <i>muda&#773;hana</i> may be applied to a
    conspiracy of silence when it comes to other people's
    transgressions and blatant deviations. It is turning one's eyes
    away from those who commit abominations for some worldly gain.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Etiology</h3>
  
  <p>One of Satan's tactics is to keep people so
    occupied with fear of losing their wealth that this culminates in
    them desperately clinging to their money and depriving the
    needy&mdash;and themselves&mdash;of the goodness of giving for the
    sake of God. A person under the spell of irrational fear is more
    vulnerable to transgressing laws, even to the point of indulging
    in lewdness, for the purpose of gaining profit and wealth.</p>


</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>God is the Provider and source of all wealth and comfort. He has
    promised that those who believe in Him and expend on behalf of the
    indigent shall receive a far more valuable return than the measure
    of what they spend.</p>

  <p><i>And whoever fears God, He will make for him a way out. And He
      will provide for him in a way he never expected. And whoever
      trusts in God, He is sufficient for him</i> (QUR'AN,
      65:2&ndash;3). The stipulations in receiving this provision are
      that one have true <i>taqwa&#773;</i> (God consciousness) and
      nurture it so that it permits one to walk the earth with
      dignity.</p>

  <p>The cure for fear of poverty is to have a good opinion of God,
    says the Imam. People who harbor good thoughts about their
    Provider deflect insidious whisperings about Him and the subtle
    provocations that create irrational fear. His dominion is never
    diminished in the least when He gives to His creation all that
    they need. And if someone else is given more, one should not
    harbor bad thoughts toward that person. Wholesome thoughts about
    God express themselves in one's contentment with what he or she
    has and not in stretching one's eyes toward the assets of
    others.</p>

</div>

<p><em>"Satan threatens you with poverty, and he commands you to
immorality. But God promises you His forgiveness and bounty"</em> (QUR'AN,
2:268)</p>

<p>"I've had thousands of problems in my life. Most of which never
actually happened" (Mark Twain).</p>

<p>"Anxiety is half of aging" (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"Righteousness will lengthen your life" (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"We mend our livelihood with the cloth of our religion. In the end,
nothing of the religion remains, and our worldly condition goes
unmended" (Ibn Khaldu̅n, quoting a poet).</p>

<p><em>"I do not desire from [people] any provision, nor do I desire that
they feed Me"</em> (QUR'AN, 51:57).</p>

<p>"Contentment is a treasure that is never exhausted" (The Prophet
ﷺ).</p>
