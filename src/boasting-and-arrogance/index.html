<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d speaks next about <i>fakhr</i>, which is the
    loathsome practice of boasting. Exceptionally odious is the
    practice of bragging about what one has not done or exerted any
    effort toward, like bragging about one's ancestry and borrowing
    from some past nobility. Boasting is a problematic behavior that
    universally evokes objection and is considered a spiritual
    disease. Non one lies a boaster, one who walks with a swank and
    swagger, and one who cannot be in the company of other people
    without speaking about himself or drawing attention to what he has
    done. God Himself reveals His dislike of bragging: "<i>God does
    not love the arrogant and boasting ones</i>" (QUR'AN, 31:18,
    57:23).
  </p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d mentions the force behind the culture of
    boasting, namely, arrogance (<i>kibr</i>). "Deem that mountain
    insignificant," he says, "if you desire to sink it to the ground."
    The word for "arrogance" in Arabic stems from a root-word
    signifying "growth," either in mass or age. With arrogance, what
    is alluded to is glorification and aggrandizement of the self.</p>
  <p>The most villainous beings in history were filled with arrogance
    and false pride: Satan, Pharaoh, the opponents of the Prophet
    &#65018;, and many nefarious tyrants since. The Prophet &#65018;
    warned against arrogance: "No one who has an atom's weight of
    arrogance in his heart will enter Paradise." God said, "<i>I will
    divert My signs from those who show arrogance without right</i>"
    (QUR'AN, 7:146). That is, God recompenses the arrogant ones by
    turning them away from understanding His Book, His prophets, and
    His signs placed all around them as well as within their own
    selves. God also says that He, "<i>sets a seal upon the heart of
    every arrogant tyrant</i>" (QUR'AN, 4:35), and "<i>He does not
    love those who wax arrogant</i>" (QUR'AN, 16:23). One of the
    attributes of God, the Exalted, is that He is the Proud
    (al-Mutakabbir), an attribute that is reserved for Himself. It is
    not becoming for anyone to have any of it in his or her heart.
  </p>
  <p>Justice follows every vice. When it comes to arrogance, its
    possessors will culminate in being the most abject people in the
    Hereafter; they will envy those whom they once thought to be
    beneath them in honor and status, those who were patient,
    grateful, and humble in this life.</p>
  <p><b>Types of arrogance</b></p>
  <p>The <b>first</b> type is when a person deems himself superior to
    others. Imam al-Ghaza&#773;l&#305;&#773; said, "People of
    knowledge are in greater danger of arrogance than anyone else";
    this is because the knowledge they have attained may lead them to
    feelings of superiority.</p>
  <p>The <b>second</b> type of arrogance is in displaying contempt and
    scorn towards others. Once a man saw an old woman calling to the
    Prophet &#65018; in a boisterous manner, yet the Prophet &#65018;
    stopped to speak with her, showing no sign of annoyance. When the
    man saw the Prophet's calm reaction, he said, "Muh&#803;ammad
    &#65018; is a man unlike the kings of other lands." It is a marvel
    how some people act arrogantly because of their perceived piety,
    while the Prophet &#65018;, "the best of creation," remained
    humble.</p>
  <p>The <b>third</b> type of arrogance relates to lineage. In some
    cultures, if one is aware of his "high birth," he is obliged to
    behave nobly. The Arabs manifested this. If a man was born into a
    clan known for generosity, it was mandatory for him to be
    generous. One of the blights of many societies is racism: people
    feel and act superior simply because of their race. The Qur'an
    nullifies false claims of superiority and states that the only
    rank that matters relates to one's relationship with God:
    "<i>Indeed, the most honorable of you in the sight of God are the
    most God-fearing of you. Surely, God is all-knowing,
    all-aware</i>" (QUR'AN, 49:13).</p>
  <p>The <b>fourth</b> type of arrogance is that which is owing to
    beauty. Social conditioning impacts our sense of beauty more than
    many would admit.</p>
  <p>The <b>fifth</b> type of arrogance is that which stems from
    having wealth. The affluent are notorious for showing contempt for
    those of lesser means. This is not to say that all wealthy people
    exhibit this disease. There are generous men and women who
    recognize the source and responsibility of wealth. However, they
    tend to be the exception.</p>
  <p>The <b>sixth</b> type is based on physical strength.</p>
  <p>The <b>seventh</b> is due to possessing an abundance of
    something. An example of this is a teacher having many students
    and thus regarding himself as being better than the other teachers
    who have fewer students. The same is true with those who boast of
    having many friends, especially those in so-called high
    places.</p>
  <p>The <b>eighth</b> type of arrogance is linked to having
    knowledge. This type of arrogance is particularly insidious, since
    knowledge is a greatly honorable matter. However, a knowledgeable
    person may become deluded into believing himself to be superior
    over others due to the veneration shown to him.</p>
  <p><b>Moderation (<i>wasat&#803;iyyah</i>)
  </b></p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d's touches upon the Islamic ethic of moderation
    (<i>wasat&#803;iyyah</i>). While humility is a praise-worthy
    virtue, if it is carried out excessively, it results in
    abasement. According to some classical Christian theological
    paradigms, abasement is praised, but that is not the case in
    Islam. Abject humiliation is disapproved of, even in the face of
    tribulation. Those who face tests with dignity and patience are
    praised. Hence, humility is different from  humiliation.
  </p>
  <p><b>Posture of humility</b></p>
  <p>Many find the Muslim prayer objectionable because of its postures
    of humility and awe before God. What they struggle with is not
    merely the postures but their aversion to submit to God, being His
    servant. People have difficulty with that, claiming that they are
    "free." Astonishingly, these same "free" people are in bondage to
    their whims and passions.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>There are several cures for arrogance. First, we should remember
    our humble organic origins. As the Qur'an reminds us, every one of
    us is created from a drop of semen (QUR'AN, 75:37). God says,
    "<i>Perished is man! How ungrateful he is! From what stuff did He
    create him? From a sperm drop He created him and proportioned
    him</i>" (QUR'AN, 80:16&ndash;19). God also says, "<i>Let man
    reflect from what he was created. He was created from an ejected
    fluid that issues from between the loins and the ribs</i>"
    (QUR'AN, 86:5&ndash;7). Furthermore, God says, "<i>Has there come
    over man a time when he was nothing remembered? We created man
    from sperm drop mixed in order to try him</i>" (QUR'AN,
    76:1&ndash;2). These reminders should suppress any insurgence of
    arrogance and conceit.
  </p>
  <p>Muslims should venerate religious heroes. In studying the
    personalities of the Companions of the Prophet &#65018;, one
    learns of incredibly great people who were extraordinarily
    humble.</p>
  <p>It is better to simulate humility than to be an outright arrogant
    man.</p>
  <p>The cure for arrogance that is owing to beauty is to realize that
    beauty can be the most illusory of things. One should ponder over
    why beauty could even be a cause of arrogance? That is, how can
    one have an obnoxious sense of superiority for something one had
    nothing to do with? First of all, God is the Fashioner; it is He
    who gives all things their shapes and forms. Secondly, beauty does
    not last; it wanes, as the pressures of age and stress wear down
    flesh, so what remains is what one should have focused on the
    first place: the content of one's character, personal beliefs, and
    one's deeds.</p>
  <p>God created humanity and has bestowed human beings with more
    blessings than He has given the rest of His creation. However,
    blessings are coupled with responsibility. The intellectual and
    volitional capacities of humankind are great
    responsibilities. Ironically, it is these very capacities which
    have the potential of causing people to forget that every
    blessings we have is a gift from God and is something that we are
    responsible for. "<i>Have We not given [man] two eyes, a tongue,
    and two lips, and shown him the two highways [of good and evil]?
    Yes he does not attempt the steep road [of good]</i> (QUR'AN,
    90:8&ndash;11). The steep road here is spending on orphans,
    relieving the distressed, and all other good actions that are
    difficult for the arrogant ones, as they feel that their wealth,
    strength, and prestige are borne of their own devices. People
    rejected the Prophet's message not because they were not
    convinced. They knew that what the Prophet &#65018; brought was
    the truth from God Himself, but they rejected him out of
    arrogance.
    </p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d says that the key to avoiding or removing this
    disease is to know yourself, your origins, and your ultimate
    return. Prophet's honor was entirely based on his servitude to
    God, the Exalted&mdash;not on wealth, lineage, power, or
    authority. Whoever is humbled for the sake of God, God elevates in
    rank. Haughtiness and gratitude cannot coexist in one vessel. God
    increases in goodness those who are grateful. The station of
    arrogance invites only humiliation.</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d says humility, by nature, leads to gratitude,
    for when one is humble before God, the Exalted, only then does one
    see the vast mercy God bestows upon His creation, even upon liars
    and disbelievers.</p>
</div>

<p>"Be not content with stories of those who went before you. Go forth
and create your own story" (Mawla̅na̅
Ru̅mı̅).</p>

<p>"If your actions hold you back, your lineage will not speed you up."</p>

<p>"No person of any consequence should respect or praise an ignorant
man, even if he is of noble birth and virtuous ancestry, for
respecting and praising such a person in his presence may have an
adverse effect on him. It may deceive him concerning God, render him
neglectful of proper behavior, and distract him from gathering
provision for the Hereafter" (Imam al-Ḥadda̅d).</p>

<p>"A man carries feces between his two sides" (A righteous forebear).</p>

<p>Abu̅ Hurayrah (may God be pleased with him), the illustrious
repository of prophetic hadith, once sat in the company of another
person; this man immediately moved his feed away from Abu̅
Hurayrah out of respect for the august Companion of the Prophet
ﷺ. Upon noticing that, Abu̅ Hurayrah asked, "Why did you
move your feet?" The man replied, "Out of deference to you." Abu̅
Hurayrah responded, "For someone like me? I do not see anyone in this
gathering worse than me."</p>

<p>A cousin of 'Alı̅ ibn Abı̅ Ṭa̅lib (may
God be pleased with him) once asked him, "Who is better, you or
Abu̅ Bakr?" Imam 'Alı̅ answered, "Abu̅ Bakr." And
when asked the same question about 'Umar (may God be pleased with
him), he answered, "'Umar." He then asked him, "What rank do you
have?" Imam 'Alı̅ replied, "I am a Muslim among many."</p>

<p>"If you are aware of your humility, then you are arrogant" (Ibn
'Aṭa̅'alla̅h).</p>

<p>"If you are not like the real people, at least mimic them."</p>

<p>"If one wishes to master calligraphy, then he must go to a master
calligrapher and repeat what he does" (Imam
al-Ghaza̅lı̅).</p>

<p>"A believer never humiliates himself" (A hadith).</p>

<p>"All the doors to God are crowded except for one: the door of humility
and humbleness" ('Abd al-Qa̅dir al-Jila̅nı̅).</p>

<p>"Among the most noble things of this world is a rich man who is
humble."</p>

<p>"<em>[God] has created death and life to test you as to which of you is
best in deed</em>" (QUR'AN, 67:2).</p>

<p>"I am the best of the children of Adam and I am not boasting" (The
Prophet ﷺ).</p>
