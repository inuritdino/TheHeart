  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d speaks of something that is very easy to have
    but is harmful to brotherhood and injurious to one's own spiritual
    growth. It is having a bad opinion about others, baseless
    assumptions, and suspicion (<i>z&#803;ann</i>). This is allowing
    conjecture into one's heart without having any facts, which is
    especially harmful when one harbors a bad opinion about people who
    are outwardly righteous in appearance, which was something that
    the early Muslims considered important.</p>
  <p><b><i>Fira&#773;sah</i>
  </b></p>
  <p><i>Fira&#773;sah</i> is having the intuitive ability to see in
    people signs of goodness or evil. The Prophet &#65018; had this
    ability to the utmost degree and said that believers possess it
    also, but to a lesser extent. S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773;
    Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q said that every believer has the power
    of <i>fira&#773;sah</i> to variant degrees based on the strength
    of his or her faith.</p>
  <p><b>Reasonable doubts</b></p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d says next that having doubts about someone's
    character is not forbidden if it is based on reason and observable
    evidence. This is different from suspicion that tends to be
    judgmental and, oftentimes, specious.</p>
  <p><b>Good opinion</b></p>
  <p>Having doubts about people is different from decidedly judging
    them negatively. Forming a bad opinion in the presence of ample
    evidence is common sense. However, when people repent, they should
    not have their past held against them. According to sacred law,
    people are innocent until proven guilty. This relates to having a
    good opinion of God.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
  <p>Having a bad opinion of someone without cause is considered a
    malady of the heart. Often associated with this disease is
    backbiting (<i>gh&#305;&#773;bah</i>), that is, speaking ill of
    another person behind his or her back. It is possible to backbite
    in an unspoken form, as when a person has unfounded negative
    thoughts against another person. Suspicion in the heart that
    affects one's thoughts and opinion of another person is considered
    backbiting of the heart (<i>gh&#305;&#773;bat al-qalb</i>). This
    also is not permissible.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>Scholars have advised that one should even beware of forming
    conclusions based on the bad appearance of people, for it could be
    that God veiled their goodness from others.</p>
  <p>If someone says to you that a given person is bad, ask for
    proof. Without proof, it is tantamount to a lie. The sacred law of
    Islam (shariah) is based on proof and not conjecture.</p>
  <p>If someone known to openly indulge in major sins comes with some
    news, one should not accept it without circumspection. One should
    test someone's sincerity and trustworthiness before entrusting him
    with anything significant (S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad
    Zarru&#773;q). If there is much corruption in a given generation,
    it is best to be wary of people until their goodness becomes
    manifest. This is the advise of the scholars.</p>
  <p>Scholars also say that one should be circumspect with the
    dispensation of zakat. In times in which goodness prevails over
    corruption, the default is to accept the word of people who claim
    they qualify for zakat and ask for it. However, when corruption
    and fraud are prevalent, then those responsible are obliged to be
    rigorous in their investigation. Charity is considered a trust
    from God, and its dispensation must be done with care.</p>
</div>

<p>"<em>O you who believe, avoid suspicion, for some suspicion is sinful</em>"
(QUR'AN, 49:12).</p>

<p>"<em>O you who believe, if an ungodly person brings you some news, then
seek out its veracity</em>" (QUR'AN, 49:6).</p>

<p>"Do not trust anyone with matters related to your religion, your
family, or your wealth until you have tested him at least a thousand
times" (Sı̅dı̅ Aḥmad Zarru̅q).</p>

<p>"There are two things no believer has been given anything better than:
a good opinion of God and a good opinion of the servant of God" (A
hadith).</p>

<p>A hadith states that God says, "I am in the opinion of My servant. If
he thinks well of Me, he finds good, and if he thinks ill of Me, he
finds evil."</p>

<p>"If [someone] finds good, let him thank God, and whoever finds other
than that, let him blame only his own soul" (A hadith).</p>

<p>"Beware of a bad opinion, for it is the most false of speech" (The
Prophet ﷺ).</p>
