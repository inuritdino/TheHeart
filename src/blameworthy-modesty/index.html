<div id="definition"> 

  <h3>Definition</h3>

  <p>Modesty becomes blameworthy if it prevents one from denouncing
    what clearly should be denounced, such as tyranny or
    corruption. This form of modesty results in meekness at a time
    when one needs to be forthright and courageous.</p>

</div>
<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Symptoms</h3>
  <p>Blameworthy modesty results in timid failure to denounce what
    unequivocally deserves denouncement or to ask about important
    matters from those who are knowledgeable.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>Something condemnable (<i>munkar</i>) is condemnable regardless
    of the status of the person who is engaged in it&mdash;whether he
    or she is a close relative or a person of status, wealth, or
    authority.</p>

  <p>There must be agreement, however, among scholars on what is
    condemnable. One cannot, for example, declare decisively that
    something is considered condemnable if there is a difference of
    opinion on it among the scholars. Scholars knowledgeable of the
    plentitude of juristic differences rarely condemn others. They
    refrain from such condemnation not because of modesty but because
    of their extensive knowledge and scholarly insight. Unfortunately,
    many people today are swift to condemn, which creates another
    disease: self-righteousness.</p>

  <h3>Example 1 (seeking knowledge)</h3>

  <p>A woman once came to the Prophet &#65018; asking a specific
    question about menstruation. The Prophet &#65018; answered her,
    but the woman persisted in asking for more detail. The Prophet
    &#65018; then asked Aisha to show the woman what he meant, for it
    was awkward for him. Some women even sent the cloth used for their
    menstrual protection to seek out with certainty what constitutes
    the beginning and the end of the menses, which determines whether
    or not certain rites of worship may be resumed. Most women would
    not feel comfortable with that, but the modesty of these women did
    not prevent them from seeking out knowledge about their religious
    affairs.</p>

  <h3>Example 2 (virtuous modesty)</h3>

  <p>Virtuous modesty is rooted in generosity and kindness; this is an
    acceptable kind of modesty.</p>

  <p>The Prophet &#65018; invited people for a wedding ceremony and
    meal. The guests came but lingered in his presence much longer
    than necessary. In fact, three of them remained late into the
    evening. The Prophet &#65018;, in his generosity, stayed with them
    and patiently waited for his guests to complete their visit. The
    guests, however, tarried with the Prophet &#65018; because they
    loved his company.</p>

  <p>The Prophet &#65018; was too modest to tell his guests that it
    was time to leave.</p>
</div>

<p>"The best women were the women of the Ansar because modesty did not
prevent them from learning the religion" (Aisha, The Prophet's wife)</p>

<div class="poem">
  <p>Had modesty been a person, it would have been a righteous</p>

  <p>one and would do nothing but good in whatever it did.</p>
</div>

<p><em>"[Believers], when you are invited, then enter. And when you have
completed the meal, disperse, and do not linger on for
conversation. This used to hurt the Prophet, but he shied away from
[telling] you. But God is not shy of the truth"</em> (Qur'an, 33:53)</p>
