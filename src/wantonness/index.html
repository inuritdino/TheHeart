<div id="definition"> 

	<h3>Definition</h3> 

	<p>Excessive mirth, which, according to the people of knowledge, is
	having excessive exuberance.</p>
	
	<p>Excessiveness, an unbridled desire to need and want more.</p>
	
	<p>(From Arabic <i>ba<span class="dotunder">t</span>ar</i>): 
	"the inability to bear blessings; bewilderment; 
	dislike of something undeserving of dislike; and reckless extravagance."</p>

</div>

<div id="etiology"> 

	<h3>Signs</h3> 

	<p>Wantonness is a disease to which the world's affluent societies are particularly vulnerable.
	One sign of these conditions is the ease with which people enter into debt and live 
	contentedly with it.</p>
	
	<p>Images glorifying wantonness are ubiquitous in our times [...]: people in ecstatic postures 
	with exaggerated smiles and gaping mouths, showing off their supreme happiness because they own
	a particular type of car or smoke a certain brand of cigarettes or guzzle a special brand
	of beer &mdash; alcohol that destroys lives and minds. According to advertising theory, 
	when people are constantly exposed to such images, they not only incline toward the product
	but desire the culture associated with it. Advertisers sell a lifestyle that glorifies
	wantonness and subtly dissuades reflection.</p>

</div>

<div id="cure"> 

	<h3>Treatment</h3> 

	<p>To intentionally experience hunger and to reflect seriously on death and the Hereafter.
	</p>

	<p>All those smiling people on (advertising) billboards (see above) and all those who aim their 
	glances toward them will
	inevitably die someday and stand before their Maker. This is the ultimate destiny of all
	human beings. It is this realization that is the slayer of wantonness.</p>

now uninhabited after them except for a few"</em> (QUR'AN, 28:58).</p>
