<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Heedlessness (<i>ghaflah</i>) is a terrible lack of attention to
    what is infinitely more important in one's life than material
    goods. Imam al-Junayd, a prominent ninth century scholar, argues
    that heedlessness is the one pathogen that breeds all the rest of
    the diseases of the heart.</p>
  <p>The heedlessness that Imam Mawlu&#773;d speaks of here is that of
    its most menacing form: being heedless of divine purpose,
    accountability, the resurrection, ultimate standing, and judgment
    in the Hereafter. The full manifestation of these events is
    veiled to us by the thin wall of death, the timing of which is the
    secret that hovers above the heads of all men and women. Even
    though the reality of these things is hidden in the realm of the
    unseen, what is expected of us is to receive and accept the
    message the Prophet &#65018; brought. This was the duty of all the
    prophets&mdash;to call people to believe in the unseen, to trust
    what they say, and to commit to their teachings.</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d says <i>ghaflah</i> is also heedlessness of
    what God has commanded and what He has prohibited, or seeing the
    difference between the two as irrelevant.</p>
  <p>God warns the Prophet &#65018; from conforming to those whose
    hearts are in the state of heedlessness (QUR'AN, 18:28).</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
  <p>In the Qur'an, you will find <i>ghaflah</i> mentioned several
    times in different forms, but almost invariably referring to
    unawareness. The Qur'an uses other words to refer to
    unawareness. Those who laugh at the Qur'an
    are <i>sa&#773;midu&#773;n</i> (QUR'AN, 53:61); they are so
    immersed in amusement they are oblivious of reality. God speaks of
    the disbelievers impervious to the message of the prophets as
    having a cover (<i>ghisha&#773;wah</i>) over their eyes (QUR'AN,
    2:7). The ultimate trauma of heedlessness, then, is not seeing
    reality as it truly is. It is choosing a way of living that allows
    divine signs to be left unnoticed.</p>
  <p>There is a well-known allegory of some people in a cave: at the
    entrance of the cave was a lamp which cast shadows that the people
    in the cave believed to be realities. When one person left the
    cave and saw the real world&mdash;the sun, the stars, and the
    trees&mdash;he raced back in the cave to tell the others that
    there was much more to their world than what they saw in their
    cave. But the people feared what he said, causing them to deny,
    ridicule, and then physically attack him. The prophets came to
    rouse people from their stupor, to take them from their delusion
    and heedlessness to awareness. Many of the prophets were slain;
    all faced harsh opposition.</p>
  <p>God increases the heedlessness of people who turn away from the
    truth.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>On of the cures for heedlessness is keeping good and sincere
    company. It is recognized in virtually all traditions and cultures
    that the company one keeps has inroads to one's heart and
    morality. When surrounded by people who are sincere and trustworthy,
    one only benefits from them. Even when a person errs, good
    companions remind him and set him right.</p>
  <p><b>The four practices</b></p>
  <p>The cure is in four practices that possess authentic rectifying
    qualities. The <b>first</b> is repentance and seeking
    forgiveness. As a matter of regular worship, one should ask for
    forgiveness (<i>istighfa&#773;r</i>) at least 70 or 100 times a
    day, according to the Prophetic practice, which was closely
    followed by our righteous forebears (<i>salaf</i>). This practice
    is connected to accounting for one's deeds. At the day's end, the
    merchant looks at his ledger to calculate his earnings, to see
    what "the scales say," so to speak. The moral scales are no less
    important, and each of us is a merchant with regard to what we
    lost or gained with respect to God's pleasure. When there is loss,
    which is a frequent occurrence, seeking God's forgiveness restores
    balance.
  </p>
  <p>The <b>second</b> practice is visiting (<i>ziya&#773;rah</i>)
    righteous people, who enjoy rank with God, the Exalted. The
    word <i>s&#803;a&#773;lih&#803;</i> (righteous) conveys the notion
    of soundness of heart and excellent character. More specifically,
    it refers to one who gives God His due right by fulfilling His
    commandments and avoiding what He prohibited (e.g., a righteous
    person does not cheat or lie). Scholars have always encouraged
    visiting righteous people as part of the protocol of the spiritual
    ascendancy. These people include the living as well as the
    dead. Visiting graves is a poignant reminder of death and the
    Hereafter. It is an armament against heedlessness.</p>
  <p>When visiting a righteous person, the discourse should be
    substantive and not one of idle talk. One should seek to benefit
    in gaining knowledge and in the supplication of the righteous
    person. In fact, one should ask for being continually remembered
    in their prayers, for their prayers might be more acceptable to
    God than one's own.</p>
  <p>Just as one is recommended to visit the righteous, one should
    strive to be the righteous person that others seek out to
    visit.</p>
  <p>The <b>third</b> cure is to invoke benedictions on the Prophet
    &#65018;. This is, in fact, a command from God, the Exalted,
    Himself: "<i>O you who believe, invoke benedictions upon [the
    Prophet] and salutations of peace</i>" (QUR'AN, 33:56). There is
    great light associated with invoking prayers of benediction upon
    the Prophet &#65018;. S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad
    Zarru&#773;q once said, "If you do not have
    a <i>murabb&#305;&#773;</i> [a spiritual mentor], then say prayers
    of blessings upon the Prophet &#65018;, which acts as
    a <i>murabb&#305;&#773;</i>." Many scholars have attested to the
    fact that sending prayers of blessings upon the Prophet &#65018;
    purifies the soul. (Some recommend that one repeat it at least 500
    times a day.) Some people make it their practice to repeat it
    5,000 times a day. Imam Ma&#773;lik constantly sent prayers of
    blessings on the Prophet
    &#65018;. The <i>muh&#803;addithu&#773;n</i> (scholars of
    prophetic traditions) are well known for this practice.
  </p>
  <p>The <b>fourth</b> cure for heedlessness is the recitation of the
    Qur'an. Reciting it with <i>tadabbur</i> (reflection) awakens the
    heart. However, plain recitation is beneficial as well. Learned
    Muslims have recommended that a person recite one&ndash;thirtieth
    of the Qur'an (<i>juz</i>) every day. If this is difficult, then
    reciting Sura Ya&#773;s&#305;&#773;n (36) after the dawn prayer,
    Sura al-Wa&#773;qi'ah (56) after the sunset prayer, and Sura
    Al-Mulk (68) after the evening prayer greatly benefit the
    soul. The actual sounds of the language of the Qur'an&mdash;the
    breathtaking rhythms and words&mdash;are a medicine. From the
    perspective of energy dynamics, every substance has a resonance at
    a specific wavelength. A medicine resonates in order to cure the
    disease. So, too, do the sounds of recitation of the Qur'an: "<i>O
    humankind, there has come to you from your Lord counsel and
    healing for what is in the breasts, and a guidance and a mercy to
    the believers</i> (QUR'AN, 10:57). When one recites the Qur'an,
    one moves his or her tongue pronouncing revealed words of the Lord
    of the heavens and the earth. And these words have a powerful and
    unique sound. People are often amazed at the sound of the Qur'an,
    when they hear it for the first time. The beauty of the Qur'an is
    in its meanings as well as the sound of its recitation.
  </p>
</div>

<p>"<em>You were once heedless of this. Now We have removed your veil
[ghiṭa̅'] from you, so your sight this day is sharp!</em>"
(QUR'AN, 50:22)</p>

<p>"[O God] Show me the truth as truth and give me the ability to follow
it; and show me falsehood as falsehood and give me the ability to
avoid it" (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"God has made the ways of gaining lawful provision
innumerable. Someone who uses religious pretensions in order to profit
is especially wicked" (A learned man in Fez, Morocco).</p>

<p>"If you do not believe that God can take you at this moment and make
you one of His saintly believers (<i>awliya̅h</i>), then you are
ignorant of His power" (Imam Ibn 'Aṭa̅'alla̅h).</p>

<p>An interesting aspect of heedlessness is that everyone will eventually
be cured of it, no matter what the extent of this disease. The
challenge is to be cured in this life, the time when our obedience in
the arena of test and trials holds meaning. The moment a person dies,
veils are lifted. Even the denizens of Hellfire will no longer live in
the Hell of heedlessness. We were created to remember God, and if it
takes the heat of Hell to remind some, then that is how it will be. We
ask God to make us among those who remember Him in this life and among
those who are saved in the Hereafter.</p>
