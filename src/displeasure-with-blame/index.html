<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Blame is not something that people naturally embrace. It runs
    against human nature to love it. However, the problem occurs when
    fear of blame is coupled with the urgent desire for praise and
    approval by others, which is often the case. Being concerned with
    "creation's opinion" places a barrier between a person and the
    station of <i>ih&#803;sa&#773;n</i>, excellence in
    worship. ("Creation's opinion" here in this context simply refers
    to "other people's opinions," as opposed to being concerned with
    God's pleasure.) This is considered a disease of the hearts, as it
    results in guiding one's actions in deference to the praise of
    people or in an attempt to avoid their blame or disapproval,
    irrespective of the integrity and soundness of one's actions.
  </p>
  <p>The more that one worries about how one's decisions will be
    received by people, the thicker the veil becomes with regard to
    God and His guidance.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Signs and symptoms</h3>
  <p>Muslims have a great responsibility. God says, "<i>Thus have We
      made you a middle nation, so that you may be witnesses for
      humankind</i>" (QUR'AN, 2:143); hence, the Muslims comprise a
      people who should enjoin justice and remind humanity of God's
      rights. When people give up enjoining what is right or even
      admitting that there are absolute and objective values, which
      are not subject to the whims of mankind, then evil spreads. The
      best of witnesses was the Prophet &#65018;, then his Companions,
      and then their successors. Each generation subsequently takes on
      this office of witnessing, although hardly to the degree
      exhibited in the early generations. Towards the end of earthly
      time, the world will be virtually without witnesses to truth,
      and truth itself will be scarce. No one will defend
      it. According to Imam al-Biqa&#773;'&#305;&#773;, one of the
      signs of the end of time is the handing over of the world to the
      disbelievers, with Muslims abandoning Islam and its claim upon
      Muslims to defend the truth and censure what is
      wrong. S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q said
      that the truth has the power to penetrate the hearts of people,
      including those whose hearts have a seal. Humanity has the right
      to have among us witnesses to the truth, those who are willing
      to defend the truth no matter how unpopular it may be.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>Overcoming the fear of blame is achieved through realizing that
    there is no benefit or harm except by God's permission and
    plan. This should sound familiar, as it is the recommended cure
    for many of the diseases discussed. Two of God's most excellent
    names are the Giver of benefit (al-Na&#773;fi') and the Bringer of
    harm (al-D&#803;a&#773;rr). These attributes are specific to God
    alone; non one else possesses them in the least. It is only God
    who can benefit, and only He who can permit harm. If a person is
    worried about how others receive him, then he is not aligned with
    reality.</p>
  <p>Having awareness of God's attributes does not imply that people
    should stop using their intellects, for we live in a world of
    causes. There is room for diplomacy and discretion, particularly
    of knowing when it is best to say the truth. This discretion,
    however, is not informed by the fear of blame but rather by
    clarity regarding one's objectives. Having wisdom is completely
    different from seeking the approbation of others. The Prophet
    &#65018; said that the highest form of struggle
    (<i>jiha&#773;d</i>) is to speak the truth in the face of a
    tyrant.
  </p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d says that the inordinate fear of blame can lead
    a person to engage in prohibited matters or to neglect
    obligations. If one worries about how people will receive him when
    he practices his faith, this can prevent him from performing
    obligations. The fear of blame interferes with faith. Deeds that
    are done for the sake of God cannot share other intentions,
    namely, pleasing people or seeking their favor. Doing something
    for the sake of God is the manifestation of strong faith. Whether
    one receives praise or not from anyone should be entirely
    inconsequential.</p>

<p>"Be mindful of God, and God will protect you. Be mindful of God, and
you will find Him in front of you. If you ask, ask of God. If you seek
help, seek help from God. Know that if the whole nation were to gather
together to benefit you with anything, it would benefit you only with
something that God had already prescribed for you. And if [the whole
nation] were to gather together to harm you, it would harm you only
with something that God had already prescribed for you. The pens have
been lifted and the ink has dried" (The Prophet ﷺ to Ibn
'Abba̅s)</p>
