<div id="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>Seeking reputation (<i>sum'ah</i>) is a disease of the heart
    closely related to ostentation. This disease involves desiring
    that people <i>hear</i> of one's goodness, an aural
    ostentation. It is seeking out renown: for example, a person
    wanting others to hear how much money he or she gave in
    charity.</p>
  <p>The Imam says the performing an act for the sake of God is ruined
    when one goes about informing people of it afterwards. Repentance
    restores the value of the good deed. Ibn 'Abd al-Sala&#773;m
    states that there is no harm in informing others of one's works
    for the purpose of encouraging them to do good. But even in this
    case, one must tread carefully.</p>
  <p>Metaphorically, coveting renown is the brigand who robs people on
    the road to their Lord.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology">
  <h3>Causes</h3>
  <p>The life-support for ostentation and reputation is
    covetousness. And the cause of this covetousness, according to
    S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q, is
    heedlessness (<i>ghaflah</i>). A person permits himself to forget
    that blessings are from God alone. No good or harm can come to one
    except by God's leave. This level of heedlessness is not a casual
    lapse of memory. People can become so terribly preoccupied with
    seeking things from other people that they become heedless of
    God's power and ownership. When this happens, a person opens his
    or her heart to all kinds of spiritual diseases.</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d holds that covetousness is the root cause of
    many iniquities, like slander. A person who slanders another does
    so for some perceived gain. He desires, for example, to instill
    negative thoughts in others toward the victim of his
    slander. Covetousness can be so overwhelming that it occupies
    one's mind during prayer. It also leads to insincere praise of
    others in order to derive some benefit from them.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>
  <p>S&#305;&#773;d&#305;&#773; Ah&#803;mad Zarru&#773;q holds that
    heedlessness is blindness to the providential order that God has
    set in place and sustains at every instant. A person may say,
    after recovering from an illness, "How wonderful is this
    medication! It saved my life." This is heedlessness of the fact
    that one of the attributes of God is that He is the Healer. [...]
    The properties of every chemical are in obedience; they do their
    work because of God's commands. [...] The believer who recovers
    from an illness says, "All praise is for God who has healed
    me."</p>
  <p>Imam Mawlu&#773;d next personifies "desire" and says, "If you ask
    desire itself about his trade," it will answer, "Earning
    humiliation!" As for its father, it would say, "Doubt concerning
    the divine apportioning [of provision]," meaning being skeptical
    about how material provisions are allotted to different
    people.</p>
  <p>Along with the provision that God gives, He also has provided the
    means (<i>asba&#773;b</i>) by which one must seek out his
    provision. One person may be in possession of a meal that is meant
    for another, who then is invited to the former's home for that
    very meal. So a person never loses anything by feeding a guest. It
    is a provision meant for that guest, which was already decreed by
    God.</p>
  <p>There should be no confusion about the means of attaining wealth
    and the wealth itself. When one starts to believe that his or her
    wealth is in the hands of another person, this creates a breeding
    ground for diseases, such as coveting what others have, doing
    whatever it takes to get it, and becoming angry when one does not
    receive what he or she expects.</p>
  <p>One must trust in God and seek refuge in Him from resorting to
    illicit livelihood out of fear of not having enough wealth.</p>
</div>

<p>"Whoever seeks out reputation, God will expose him on the Day of
Judgment." (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"Whoever displays his good deeds to others, God will display his bad
deeds on the Day of Judgment." (a hadith)</p>

<p>"<em>And if God were to touch you with affliction, there is none who can
relieve it save Him. And if He were to touch you with good fortune,
then [know] He is powerful over all things</em>" (QUR'AN, 6:17).</p>

<p>"Know that if an entire nation were to gather together to benefit you
with anything, it would benefit you only with something that God had
already prescribed for you. And if [an entire nation] were to gather
together to harm you, it would harm you only with something that God
had already prescribed for you." (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"Competition is the disease of civilizations." (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"Nothing will fill the mouth of the son of Adam, except the soil of
his own grave. If he had one mountain of gold, he will only desire a
second." (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"Two people will never be satiated: seekers of knowledge and seekers
of the world." (The Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"No soul will die until it completes the provision that was allotted
to it." (Angel Gabriel, peace be upon him, via the Prophet ﷺ)</p>
