<div id="definition"> 

  <h3>Definition</h3> 
  <p>Love of this world is considered blameworthy, though this does
    not include wanting things of this world in order to be free from
    burdening others with one's needs, nor does it include desiring
    provision from the world for the purpose of attaining the best of
    the Hereafter.
  </p>

  <p>For example, we should love aspects of this world that helps us
    achieve felicity in the Hereafter, such as the Qur'an, the Ka'ba,
    the Prophet &#65018;, our parents, godly people, books of
    knowledge, children, and others who help us in our religious
    affairs. As for wealth, we should love helping the needy with
    it.</p>

  <p>Love of the world is praised or blamed based on what good or harm
    it brings to a person. If it leads to a diseased heart&mdash;such
    as greediness and arrogance&mdash;then it is blameworthy. If it
    leads to spiritual elevation and healing of the heart, then it is
    praiseworthy. Anything that is obtained from the necessities of
    living on earth&mdash;food, housing, shelter, and the
    like&mdash;is beneficial and is not considered "worldly" per
    se.</p>
  
  <p>Attaining wealth and position for the benefit of the needy is not
    considered blameworthy.</p>
  
  <p>[Love of praise:] People naturally love praise, but it should be
    for something one has actually done.  Furthermore, the cause of
    praise should be something that is praiseworthy in the sight of
    God.  It is not necessarily wrong to want people to appreciate
    what one has done. One must make the distinction between flattery
    and appreciation. The Prophet &#65018; said, "Throw dirt in the
    faces of flatterers," those who pour accolades upon others, worthy
    or not, like poets who compose appallingly obsequious poetry
    praising a tyrant.</p>
  
  <p>Praising or thanking someone for doing good is expressing
    gratitude. Flatter, on the other hand, is being disingenuous with
    praise.</p>
</div>

<div id="etiology"> 

  <h3>Symptoms and causes</h3>
  <p>What scholars traditionally have warned against, with regard to
    attaining wealth, is the danger of eventual transgression. The
    more wealth one acquires, the higher the probability that one will
    become preoccupied with other than God. Also, vying for wealth can
    become an addiction and lead to ostentation, which is considered a
    disease of the heart.</p>
  
  <p>Love of praise is another disease, particularly the love of
    praise for something one has not done. This is caused by desiring
    something from other than God.</p>

  <p>People often praise others because they want something from
    them. What is particularly blameworthy is when people enjoy
    receiving praise for something they have not done.</p>

  <p>For example, in academia, some professors receive tribute for
    work their students actually did. In the corporate culture, it is
    not unheard of for managers to be credited for the accomplishment
    of a team of people, to whom the managers sometimes attribute
    nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>"The world is a bridge; so pass over it to the next world, but do not
try to build on it" (Jesus, peace be upon him).</p>

<p>"Do not curse the world, for God created the world, and the world is a
means to reaching [knowledge of] God" (the Prophet ﷺ)</p>

<p>"<em>And He has subjugated for you what is in the heavens and what is on
earth, all of it from Him. Indeed, therein are sure signs for a people
who reflect</em>" (The Qur'an, 45:13).</p>

<p>When the Prophet ﷺ learned of the good that someone had done,
he would say, "May God reward you with goodness."</p>

<p>"Whoever is not thankful to people will not be thankful to God" (the
Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"<em>Do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done and who
love to be praised for what they have not done—do not think that
they will escape punishment. Theirs shall be a painful chastisement</em>"
(The Qur'an, 3:188).</p>
