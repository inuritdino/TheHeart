  <h3>Definition</h3> 

  <p>Envy (<i>hasad</i>) is a severe disease of the heart that some
    scholars hold to be the root of all diseases, while others opine
    that the parent disease goes back to covetousness
    (<i>t&#803;ama'</i>).
  </p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>If you were to describe your desire that someone lose his
      blessing as "envy," then your description will be accurate.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Most scholars agree that it is the first manifestation of
    wrongdoing and the first cause of disobedience against God [the
    story of Satan's envy of Adam, for God chose Adam to be His
    vicegerent on earth instead of him].</p>

  <p>While it is believed that envy can bring about harm to the one
    envied, ultimately it is the envier who is harmed the most. The
    evil eye is generally related to envy, though not necessarily
    so. Some people simply have "the eye,", some type of psychic power
    that does not necessitate envy. Every culture has a concept of the
    evil eye.</p>

</div>

<div id="etiology"> 

  <h3>Symptoms</h3>

  <p>When confronted with his disobedience, Satan did not seek
    forgiveness from God. Enviers develop a mindset that makes it
    impossible for them to admit they are wrong.</p>

  <p>There are endless variations of envy, but a common thread is the
    desire that someone lose a blessing. In essence, envy arises over
    what one perceives to be a blessing in someone else's
    possession.</p>

  <p>A blessing is something that God bestows. Envy, then, is to
    desire that a person lose whatever blessing God has given him or
    her. It is tantamount to saying that God should not have given
    this person a blessing or, worse yet, that He was wrong to do so
    "because I deserve it more."</p>

  <p>It may reach the point that an envier would himself remove the
    blessing if he were able to do so through some kind of ruse.</p>

  <p>If one does not work to remove another person's blessings, then
    his or her envy is in check and is not the kind that necessarily
    devours one's good deeds. Envy that devours righteous deeds is
    envy that impels someone to wrong others. Imam
    al-Ghaza&#773;l&#305;&#773; makes a distinction between various strains
    of envy. He states that if one hates envy and is ashamed that he
    or she harbors it, the person is not essentially an envious
    person. It is important to be aware of the feelings that reside in
    one's heart.</p>

  <h3>Etiology</h3>

  <p>1. <strong>Enmity (<i>'ada&#773;wah</i>)</strong>. Harboring
    feelings of animosity toward another makes one highly susceptible
    to developing envy.</p>

  <p>2. Another cause of envy is vying for another's affection or love,
    which can become vicious.</p>

  <p>3. <strong>Arrogance (<i>takabbur</i>)</strong> is a major cause
    of envy. An arrogant man who sees someone advancing ahead of him
    will feel that this person is not worthy of such advancement.</p>

  <p>4. <strong>Low self-esteem (<i>ta'azzuz</i>)</strong>, the feeling
    that one's worth is compromised by the fact that another person
    has gained more.</p>

  <p>5. <strong>Vanity</strong>.</p>

  <p>6. <strong>Love of leadership</strong> is another major cause of
    envy.</p>

  <p>7. <strong>Avaricious cupidity, covetousness</strong>. There is a
    distinction between covetousness and love of leadership. The
    latter afflicts those who have position already, while
    covetousness relates to those who do not have it but desire it
    avariciously. This type of covetousness,
    called <i>shuh&#803;h&#803;</i> in Arabic, is a desire to have
    what is in possession of another person.</p>
</div>

<div id="cure">
  <h3>Treatment</h3>

  <p>To consciously act in opposition to one's caprice. The Arabic
    term here for caprice (<i>hawa&#773;</i>) is derived from the
    Arabic word that means, "to fall." It is also related to the
    Arabic word for "wind." One's passion is like the wind, in that it
    comes, stirs up emotion, and then dies down. One cannot really see
    it, only its effect.</p>

  <p>As a remedy to the type of envy that prods one to bring about
    harm to another person, Imam Mawlu&#773;d suggests that one
    contradict his temptation, that is, do something that will benefit
    the person who is envied. For example, give that person a gift or
    do a favor. The Imam suggests also that one may praise the person
    toward whom one feels the urge to slander.</p>

  <p>Another treatment is to know with certainty that holding envy
    against another person brings harm to oneself. Human nature's most
    primordial instinct is to avoid harm. It is easier for a person to
    repel negative feelings when he or she realizes these feelings
    hurt the soul.</p>

  <p>The basis of the remedy for envy is <i>taqwa&#773;</i>, which is
    having a sense of awe of God, an active awareness of Him as the
    ultimate power over all creation. This defuses false notions of
    misappropriated blessings.</p>

  <p>According to Imam al-Ghaza&#773;l&#305;&#773;, because these
    diseases are common to human nature, the objective should be to
    transform them into something beneficial, to transform a
    disability into an advantage, which is what successful people tend
    to do. The Prophet &#65018; said, "There is no [acceptable] envy
    except of two people." One of them is a person who has been given
    wealth and spends it toward good causes. The other person is one
    who has been given wisdom and teaches it to people. Hence, if one
    has envy, one should let it not be of fleeting things, like
    worldly assets that are usually hoarded and displayed for
    show. One should instead desire what will serve one's
    Hereafter. This is how to convert negative feelings into positive
    ones.</p>
</div>

<p>"Envy consumes good deeds the way fire devours dry wood" (The Prophet
ﷺ).</p>

<p>"Every possessor of any blessing is envied" (The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"The evil eye is true" (The Prophet ﷺ). The evil eye is not
superstition. The Prophet ﷺ worked to eradicate superstition
from the minds of people. For example, the Arabs believed that when
the moon eclipsed it meant that a great person died. When a lunar
eclipse occurred on the day the Prophet's infant son,
Ibra̅hı̅m, died, many of the Arabs were impressed by this
phenomenon. While a charlatan would have seized the moment to take
advantage of such an event, the Prophet ﷺ announced to the
people, "The moon is a sign of God; the sun is a sign of God. They do
not eclipse for anyone."</p>

<p>Al-Aṣma'ı̅, the famous Arab philologist and compiler
of poetry, once came upon a Bedouin and was invited to enter his
tent. In Bedouin culture, the women serve guests in the presence of
their husbands. This Bedouin had a very beautiful wife, though he
himself was quite unattractive. When the men went out to prepare a
lamb for a meal, the guest couldn't resist saying to this woman, "How
did such a beautiful woman like you marry such an ugly man like that?"
The woman said, "Fear God! Perhaps he had done good works accepted by
his Lord, and I am his reward." God is all-wise in what He gives to
people. If one questions the blessing a person has received, then he
or she is actually questioning the Giver. This makes envy
reprehensible and forbidden.</p>

<p>"If you have envy, do not wrong [others]" (A hadith).</p>

<p><em>"Whoever is safe from the covetousness of his own soul, he is truly
successful"</em> (QUR'AN, 59:9)</p>
