We present a summary of English Translation and Commentary by **Hamza
Yusuf** of Imam al-Mawlud's poem Matharat al-Qulub ("Purification of
the Hearts"). This summary aims at concise characterization of the
ailments of the spiritual heart and their treatment. The sound heart
ultimately benefits the person (unlike wealth and progeny), it is free
of character defects and spiritual blemishes.

Imam al-Ghazali considered knowing the ailments of the heart an
obligation upon everyone. Not every scholar would agree with this
position, yet it should suffice for this work to be justified by the
opinion of one of the greatest thinkers of the humanity.

This resource (https://heart.ruslim.org) is designed as a pocket guide
with the most essential of the descriptors and recipes to alleviate
the soul of the burden of its defects. A lightweight version becomes
handy when it comes to the accessible reading on limited resources
(e.g., web connection while traveling). For similar reasons, the pages
are designed for mobile devices as well as for wide-screen computers
to facilitate quick and efficient reference from everywhere.

We hope that this work will be beneficial: for you and for us!
