<div class="poem">

  <p>As for action that is beneficial in purifying the heart, none is
	more effective than what is consistent, even if it is slight.</p>

  <p>Include also action that is done in the absence of witnesses, or
  action done purely for His love or out of awe of His majesty.</p>

  <p>The purest deed is that done by someone free of worldly wants.
	The opposite of this is the deed of the covetous one whose
	endeavors are ultimately insignificant.</p>

  <p>The actions of those who strive out of hope are more resplendent
	and exalted than one whose striving is compelled by fear.</p>

<p>"Purification" is not a state, but an ongoing process. Just as we go
through a day careful about our bodily cleanliness, we must similarly
tend to our spiritual purity, for purification and sincerity do not
survive a passive relationship. Left unattended, the heart becomes
encrusted. Unwholesome deeds accumulate and take away its purity.</p>

<p>Scholars have commented that when the Prophet's Companions took on
supererogatory rites of worship (<i>nawa̅fil</i>), they did so
for the duration of their lives. It was something they embraced as a
spiritual practice, and they did not abandon it. This is not to say
that this is an obligation.</p>

<p>The Prophet ﷺ was a universal prophet, which means, among other
things, that he was an example for all people. He fasted and broke his
fasts. He prayed and rested. The life of Prophet ﷺ has
something for people of diverse strengths and weaknesses—for
everyone. For example, God opens the hearts of some people so that
they incline to perform night prayer. For others, He opens their
hearts to recitation of the Qur'an. For others yet, it may be that
they are inclined towards being generous. Others may find their hearts
inclining towards consistent remembrance of God. Fasting is the love
and passion of some people. And others love memorizing hadith and
teaching it.There is much in Islam and in the beautiful model of the
Prophet ﷺ that one may learn from. Very rarely do we find a
person who encompasses all (or even most) of his qualities. However,
if a person finds himself inclining to a certain supererogatory worship
rite, he should follow it and remain consistent in its practice.</p>

<h3 id="poem-verses-180ndash188">Poem verses 180–188</h3>
<div class="poem">

  <p>Of particular benefit is that which extends beyond the individual
  or is difficult for the self&mdash;such as a glutton's fast,</p>

  <p>Or the years of youth spent in avoiding wrongs and in willing
    obedience, or the contributions of a miser from the best of his
    wealth when he is of sound mind, seeking thereby the pleasure of God
    with absolute sincerity.</p>

  <p>All of these purify the heart. Moreover, doing a good deed which
    one conceals is also purifying; and the best of endeavors is one
    that purifies the heart.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the most harmful of wrongs is what hardens the heart
    and was done with consistency or [the doer] taking joy in doing
    it. Sages have preferred a wrong that engenders humility to a right
    that clothes one in a gown of self-righteous arrogance.</p>

  <p>An atom's weight of exalted praiseworthy action from the
    heart&mdash;like contentment with what one has, detachment from
    worldly things, and reliance [upon God]&mdash;</p>

  <p>Is better in God's sight than high mountains of external actions
    [without sincerity].</p>

  <p>Indeed, leaving a dollar because it is from a prohibited source
    is better than giving much in charity and [better than] several
    pilgrimages.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="discussion-1">Discussion</h3>

<p>The Imam advises also to seek out acts that are trying to the
soul. The Prophet ﷺ said that the best charity is charity given
when one is in good health and sound condition and fears
poverty. Thus, the miser should give to cleanse his heart of
miserliness; and the fear of poverty should not prevent him from
giving.</p>

<p>An abominable attitude somehow survives in some parts of the Muslim
world. It basically states that the year of responsibility is age
forty, and that before that age, one may do as he wills. This is based
on the fact that the Prophet ﷺ received revelation at that
age. However, this idea is entirely ignorant and vacuous. It is also
morally and spiritually devastating. Who can guarantee lengthy life?
And who can guarantee one will actually turn to repentance after years
of disobedience? To intentionally wreak moral havoc in anticipation of
repenting late is untenable.</p>

<p>The Imam says next that the worst things a person can do are those acts
that harden the heart. One of them is speaking a lot without
mentioning God. The more the tongue is occupied in remembering God,
the softer the heart becomes—imbued with compassion, mercy, and
love.</p>

<hr />

<p>"The best actions are the continuous ones, even if they are slight"
(The Prophet ﷺ).</p>

<p>"Do not sit in a gathering without mentioning God, for a gathering in
which God is not mentioned will harden the heart" (Jesus, peace be
upon him).</p>

<p>"Leaving one penny from what God has made forbidden is better than
going to pilgrimage 70,000 times" (Imam Saḥnu̅n).</p>
